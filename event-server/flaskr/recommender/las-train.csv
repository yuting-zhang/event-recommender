"Tuesday, September 13, 2016",All Day,Spurlock Museum of World Cultures,Medieval Irish Masterpieces in Modern Reproduction Exhibition,"“Medieval Irish Masterpieces in Modern Reproduction” showcases two extraordinary University of Illinois collections of modern reproductions of medieval Irish art. The craft of metalworking is represented by two dozen superb electrotype facsimiles of jewelry and reliquaries such as the Tara Brooch and the Cross of Cong made by the firm of Dublin jeweler Edmond Johnson, originally for the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. The art of the scribe is illustrated by ten limited-edition facsimiles of medieval Irish manuscripts such as the Leabhar Breac and the Book of Kells published by learned societies such as the Royal Irish Academy and commercial presses such as Urs Graf Verlag. Most of these reproductions were acquired by the University in and around 1916, the year of the Irish “Easter Rising” against British rule. They celebrated Irish culture as part of an Irish Foundation envisioned by Gertrude Schoepperle, a noted Celtic scholar in the English Department. This centenary exhibit and symposium places these reproductions in relation to their medieval originals and in the modern context of the “Gaelic Revival” and the construction, imagination, and study of Irish cultural heritage and national identity in Ireland and America."

In this exhibit, many pieces of this collection will be displayed alongside nineteenth- and twentieth-century facsimiles of illuminated Irish vernacular and Latin manuscripts on loan from the UIUC Library. Museum hours: Tues, 12-5; Wed-Fri, 9-5; Sat, 10-5; Sun, 12-4; closed Mondays."

The exhibition showcases Western European manuscripts from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries and examines issues associated with the production of illuminations and other decorations, patronage, as well as owner additions and modifications. It explores the impact of printing technologies and the reuse of parchment, as well as book breaking. Making and Breaking Medieval Manuscripts is a step back in time where we can learn from manuscripts then and its rippling effects into the future."

Thomas, with musical direction by Drew Minter (George A. Miller Visiting Professor). Beginning in the Garden of Eden and ending with the promise of redemption, Adam is a holiday play for all ages and any age. The first fully-staged production of this new translation premiered at The Met Cloisters on December 17th and 18th of 2016, beautifully framed by the apse of the chapel of San Martín at Fuentidueña, accompanied by ravishing vocal and instrumental music contemporary with the play. In January, the same production with its original cast of Illinois actors and New York musicians will be restaged at the lovely neo-Gothic Chapel of St. John the Divine on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Composed in colloquial rhyming verse, with passages of Latin plainsong, The Anglo-Norman Play of Adam is the oldest European play in any vernacular: in this case, an early dialect of the language we know as French. Updating the story of humanity’s fall and redemption, it comically and poignantly addresses timeless issues: ambition and desire, sibling rivalry, social mobility, and the uncertainties of political and cultural upheaval. The original text and new verse translation of the play can be accessed here. More information about the production is available here and here. All performances are free and open to the public, but seating may be limited. Doors will open 30 minutes prior to each performance. Questions or requests for reserved seating may be sent to Casey Griffin at caseyjg2@illinois.edu.

We know, too, that high sentential constraint facilitates formulating highly specific predictions for visual feature information (i.e. letter position/identity information; Luke & Christianson, 2012). Prior work using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) similarly shows neural sensitivity to visual anomalies embedded in context (Kim & Lai, 2012).   In this talk, I discuss three experiments using eyetracking and ERPs, all with the common thread of exploring how semantic constraint affects the visual expectations we have for how a sentence will unfold. In the first experiment, I discuss whether an expression’s literality impacts the creation of form-based expectations when reading frequency-matched formulaic expressions (i.e. idioms versus literal collocations) in impoverished environments. In the second set of experiments, I describe how the degree of sentential constraint is the driving force behind building visual expectations for upcoming wordforms. Results demonstrate how the amount of context preceding a target word—and not just the orthotactic legality of the target—determines the degree of neural sensitivity to unexpected orthography. "

By necessity, we often rely on data of debatable quality, relevance, and completeness to answer all manner of questions. Under these conditions, the easiest way to be certain about results is to avoid looking too closely. Data-driven uncertainty analysis takes the opposite approach; it looks very closely at the available data to determine the reliability of of the analytic results. The talk begins with a discussion of what uncertainty means in a data analytics context and why analyzing uncertainty is important. We then summarize applications and preliminary results in two domains: seismic analysis and overhead image analysis. The talk concludes with a discussion of possible long-term implications of the work."

Initiated by the Minister of Justice, and supplied with “intelligence” by the Security Police and their informants, the Commission was convened in response to the growing momentum of the Black Consciousness Movement, and the corresponding radicalization of white university students. Using the Commission's six volume report as an archive, compared and contrasted against interviews I conducted with half a dozen people that were called to testify before the Commission, I have analyzed the apartheid state's capacity to understand these new political developments.

Spanish art criticism was filled with both tremendous hope and disappointment; political hope with the installation of a restoration government and new king, and disillusionment because of the early death of the gifted artist seen by many as the leader of a hoped-for rebirth of a Spanish national school. The art critical press's response to his death demonstrates the anxiety over the international status of Spanish art in the late nineteenth century. Just as important, it also demonstrates how the history of Spanish modern art was modled by critic's melancholy and desire for objects that were, at least briefly, personified by Fortuny himself. "

"Tuesday, September 13, 2016",All Day,Spurlock Museum of World Cultures,Medieval Irish Masterpieces in Modern Reproduction Exhibition,"“Medieval Irish Masterpieces in Modern Reproduction” showcases two extraordinary University of Illinois collections of modern reproductions of medieval Irish art. The craft of metalworking is represented by two dozen superb electrotype facsimiles of jewelry and reliquaries such as the Tara Brooch and the Cross of Cong made by the firm of Dublin jeweler Edmond Johnson, originally for the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. The art of the scribe is illustrated by ten limited-edition facsimiles of medieval Irish manuscripts such as the Leabhar Breac and the Book of Kells published by learned societies such as the Royal Irish Academy and commercial presses such as Urs Graf Verlag. Most of these reproductions were acquired by the University in and around 1916, the year of the Irish “Easter Rising” against British rule. They celebrated Irish culture as part of an Irish Foundation envisioned by Gertrude Schoepperle, a noted Celtic scholar in the English Department. This centenary exhibit and symposium places these reproductions in relation to their medieval originals and in the modern context of the “Gaelic Revival” and the construction, imagination, and study of Irish cultural heritage and national identity in Ireland and America."

Examining four post-Soviet countries (Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine), the panelists assess two new functional areas of state capacity analysis, elections (regenerative) and healthcare (distributional) in addressing this question. They expand traditional approaches to state capacity through the exploration of sub-national and cross-national comparisons. Their approach contributes to important insight on the geopolitical implications of how shortfalls in state capacity might lead to “weak” or “failed” states through the examination of four countries bordering an increasingly aggressive Russian Federation. Georgia and Ukraine have already been engaged in armed hostilities with the Russian Federation which has forced them to cede territory to Russia or to breakaway quasi-states aligned with Russia. Estonia and Kazakhstan are subject to growing Russian geopolitical and economic pressure focused on border territories. This interdisciplinary roundtable explores empirical approaches to the assessment of internal diversity in state capacity, illustrating how variation in internal capacity is linked to the vulnerability to destabilization, separatist movements or incursions by adversarial neighbors across these four cases. They explore how assessments of distributional and regenerative processes within and between states can contribute to literatures in the areas of governance, conflict, legitimacy and state stability, deepening our conceptualization of state capacity in this region and elsewhere."

They told of young lovers who opted to be joined in death rather than be apart in life. The leading playwright of the genre, Chikamatsu Monzaemon, moved audiences to tears with his tragic depictions of the plights facing the lovers and their sincerity of heart in plays such as The Love Suicides at Sonezaki (1703) and The Love Suicides at Amijima (1720). Scholars have often viewed love suicide stories as entertainment, a diversion from the realities of life under shogunal rule. However, I argue that these stories, and their representations in plays of Chikamatsu in particular, were fully engaged with the social and political life of the city. The shogunal authorities recognized the potency of these stories: in 1722 and 1723, the authorities issued edicts banning the act of love suicide and its representations. My paper interrogates this moment of censorship to illuminate the ways love suicide plays posed a threat to Tokugawa rule. First, I place this moment of censorship within the broader context of censorship in the period to demonstrate how rare this form of injunction was. Second, I explain the political context of the Kyōhō Reforms, which were instigated by Tokugawa Yoshimune to restore samurai authority. Third, I explore two aspects of love suicide that challenged samurai dominance. They undermined the ideological foundation for samurai rule by promoting a value system that called the status system into question. In addition, the plays borrowed from popular Buddhism to transform the performances into religious rituals and their protagonists into saints. Through fostering a new value system that imbued the act and performance of love suicide with religious meaning, the plays represented a way to transcend current social realities and could thus be seen as a dangerous contagion calling for the government’s intervention."

She has rich experience in Sino-Arab political and economic cooperation, and has published numerous articles in this field. She is a member of the Middle East Academy of China. China's economic cooperation with Arab countries has evolved over the past several decades and has influenced its economic development and globalization processes. Thirty years ago, Chinese companies conducted a low volume of trade with a limited number of Arab countries, and focused on subcontracting low-end projects and exporting cheap labor. Today, China has become one of the Arab nations’ most important trading partners, by increasing investment and engaging in large-scale, high-end projects with local labor. This presentation will discuss China’s shift to taking a leadership role in this economic partnership with Arab nations, and from being a recipient of development expertise to being a provider of advanced equipment, technology and management experience."

"Monday, February 06, 2017",4:00 pm,"Lucy Ellis Lounge, 1080FLB",Linguistics seminar: Prof. Darren Tanner on 'Mechanisms of agreement dependency formation: Evidence for comprehension/production differences',"Mechanisms of agreement dependency formation: Evidence for comprehension/production differences   Grammatical relationships like agreement are a hallmark of natural language, such that language users must learn to compute these discontinuous dependencies in real time in both language production and comprehension. Psycholinguistic theories must therefore account for the types of information that feed these computations and the cognitive mechanisms that support them. Of particular interest in recent theorizing is the relationship between comprehension and production, with many researchers arguing that there is a large degree of overlap between the two tasks. In particular, many recent theories have posited that language production processes at least partially support language comprehension (e.g., Dell & Chang, 2014; Pickering & Garrod, 2013; see also MacDonald, 2013; Segaert et al., 2012; Silbert et al., 2014). In this talk, I examine this issue through the lens of grammatical subject-verb agreement. A significant amount of work has documented processing of subject-verb agreement in language production and shown that a variety of morphological and semantic factors influence agreement computation, but that conceptual representations and feature markedness play an important role agreement production (Eberhard, 1997, 1999; Eberhard et al., 2005; see also Gillespie & Pearlmutter, 2011, 2012). In a series of two ERP and two self-paced reading experiments, I look at the role of these factors in comprehension (Tanner, Nicol, & Brehm, 2014; Tanner & Bulkes, 2015; Tanner, Dempsey, & Christianson, in prep). Overall, the results show that prior findings implicating conceptual representations and plural markedness effects do not extend to comprehension. The findings converge to show that there are non-trivial differences in how morphosyntactic agreement is computed in comprehension and production. I describe an agreement comprehension system that highlights the feature anticipation and memory retrieval as key mechanisms supporting morphosyntactic dependency formation."

"Tuesday, February 07, 2017",4:00 pm,Room 2090B Foreign Languages Building (2nd floor office area),"Matthieu Felt, Doctoral Candidate, Columbia University: ""A Tale of Two Brothers: Medieval Depictions of Ancient Japanese Mythology""","Abstract: In the twelfth-century, a surge of works that reference or cite the eighth-century Nihon shoki mark the rise of what is commonly referred to as the “Medieval Chronicles.” In the tradition of Nihon shoki exegesis, these materials are largely sidelined because their contents diverge markedly from the base text. This talk will illustrate one of the most important innovations of these works, the deployment of Nihon shoki as an originary narrative, using a late twelfth-century picture scroll, the Hikohohodemi no mikoto emaki. This text adapts an eighth-century Nihon shoki episode about two brothers, the younger of which falls into the lineage of the imperial genealogy, and the older of which is forced to surrender to the younger and serve as his jester. In the picture scroll version, the older brother’s capitulation is amended to say that he pledges to present offerings to the younger on court holidays, an interpretation wholly absent from the original. I show that such adaptation is widespread in materials produced in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries; in this case, the changes to the original story reflect an effort to both legitimize court holidays and couch a direct relationship between the emperor and controllers of economic capital in a remodeled vision of antiquity. Such use of Nihon shoki as an originary narrative is widespread in other contemporaneous works from the Medieval Chronicles, including poetic treatises, political histories, and military chronicles. Despite the relatively freewheeling interpretative nature of these works, their deployment is firmly connected to Nihon shoki reception in the preceding period, and their innovations set the stage for a new approach to its exegesis in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries."

"Tuesday, September 13, 2016",All Day,Spurlock Museum of World Cultures,Medieval Irish Masterpieces in Modern Reproduction Exhibition,"“Medieval Irish Masterpieces in Modern Reproduction” showcases two extraordinary University of Illinois collections of modern reproductions of medieval Irish art. The craft of metalworking is represented by two dozen superb electrotype facsimiles of jewelry and reliquaries such as the Tara Brooch and the Cross of Cong made by the firm of Dublin jeweler Edmond Johnson, originally for the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. The art of the scribe is illustrated by ten limited-edition facsimiles of medieval Irish manuscripts such as the Leabhar Breac and the Book of Kells published by learned societies such as the Royal Irish Academy and commercial presses such as Urs Graf Verlag. Most of these reproductions were acquired by the University in and around 1916, the year of the Irish “Easter Rising” against British rule. They celebrated Irish culture as part of an Irish Foundation envisioned by Gertrude Schoepperle, a noted Celtic scholar in the English Department. This centenary exhibit and symposium places these reproductions in relation to their medieval originals and in the modern context of the “Gaelic Revival” and the construction, imagination, and study of Irish cultural heritage and national identity in Ireland and America."

The art in this exhibit is selected from the final projects completed by students in LLS 230: Latinx Genders & Sexualities. Students were asked to create original art that centered protest messages about the social harm facing Latinx people today, especially the violence and trauma that exists at the intersections of race, gender and sexuality.

But what of forms of thought that construct racial differences among African populations themselves, including those that have led to violence in places such as Rwanda, Darfur, Ivory Coast, and northern Nigeria? To understand those, one must dispense with simplistic models of colonial rulers imposing Western ideas on their subjects. African racial thought had a multiplicity of sources, including locally-inherited discourses of difference with deep histories in African intellectual history (discourses that later become entangled with Western forms). They included African forms of stadial historicism that, in a convergence with Enlightenment concepts, imagined racial difference as a product of the different positions that communities of descent occupied on ladders of civilizational progress. Pursuing these and related issues requires rethinking many assumptions about the nature of racial thought, including our own, and its relationship to other forms of ethnicity and groupness."

The Viking age migration of a mixed Nordic/Celtic population and farming economy across the North Atlantic briefly spread a common language and culture from the Baltic to Newfoundland, creating many culture contact situations and bringing farmers into some of the last settled places on earth. After the Viking age expansion ca. 750-1000 CE, the different island communities took different adaptive pathways as they created distinctive cultural landscapes, coped with sudden and profound climate change, and experienced the early globalization impacts of a high medieval world system. This talk presents new data and new perspectives on long term human ecodynamics in the offshore islands of the Faroes, Iceland, and Greenland. The three different island cases provide examples of both successful millennial scale management of fragile natural resources, and adverse impacts leading to severe environmental degradation. It will also present an updated view of the end of Norse Greenland, a community that we now know did not ""choose to fail"" (Daimond 2005) but instead showed great resilience and adaptive flexibility but perished anyway. Past long term human interactions with landscape, resources, changing climate, and inter-regional economic forces are increasingly being used to inform modern scenario builders seeking to shape sustainable futures- the North Atlantic provides some rich material for such lessons from the past. Bio: Dr. Thomas McGovern has done archaeological fieldwork since 1972 in the UK, Norway, France, the Caribbean, and NE US, but his main research work has been in the North Atlantic (Greenland, Iceland, Faeroes, and Shetland). McGovern was one of the founders of NABO with initial NSF support in 1992, and has served as its coordinator down to the present. "

Her research is centered on the reconstruction of the histories of past peoples and places, utilizing social theory to understand those histories. She says she is fascinated by the relationships between material culture, and social process, and how “as archaeologists we can best ‘read’ patterns in the material world as representative of real people, their experiences and sensibilities.” Her goal is “to understand how societies transform themselves, both intentionally and unintentionally, via processes involving gender, ritual, memory, traditions, identity formation and hybridity.”  "

Even at high levels of proficiency, late L2 learners experience persistent difficulty using grammatical gender online, both in oral production and in comprehension. Recent work suggests that this difficulty may at least partly reflect inaccurate mapping between representations for grammatical gender and for nouns (Hopp, 2013, 2016; Lemhöfer et al., 2014). A number of studies reporting deficits in online performance, however, also report ceiling performance in offline gender assignment tasks aimed at assessing knowledge of critical nouns used for their online tasks (e.g. Foucart & Frenck-Mestre, 2011, 2012; Grüter et al., 2012). This suggests that, even when the gender of a noun is known, processing difficulties may nonetheless obtain. In this talk, I will examine whether these difficulties might reflect delayed retrieval of grammatical gender information. I will discuss data from a set of experiments that compare the time course with which native and non-native speakers of German retrieve information about the grammatical gender of nouns. Both electrophysiological and behavioral results show that late L2 learners of German are not delayed in their retrieval of grammatical gender during lexical access for highly familiar nouns. Findings further indicate that, despite the lack of a delay, the time course of lexical feature retrieval may nonetheless differ for L2 versus L1 speakers. Overall, these findings suggest that the online use of grammatical gender in an L2 may not be constrained by delays in the retrieval of grammatical gender."

It is well known that when the graph G is decomposable, Bayesian inference is significantly more tractable than in the general non-decomposable setting. Penalized likelihood inference on the other hand has made tremendous gains in the past few years in terms of scalability and tractability. Bayesian inference, however, has not had the same level of success, though a scalable Bayesian approach has its respective strengths, especially in terms of quantifying uncertainty. To ad- dress this gap, we propose a scalable and flexible novel Bayesian approach for estimation and model selection in Gaussian undirected graphical models. We first develop a class of generalized G-Wishart distributions with multiple shape parameters for an arbitrary underlying graph. This class contains the G-Wishart distribution as a special case. We then introduce the class of Generalized Bartlett (GB) graphs, and derive an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm to obtain posterior draws from generalized G-Wishart distributions corresponding to a GB graph. The class of Generalized Bartlett graphs contains the class of decomposable graphs as a special case, but is substantially larger than the class of decomposable graphs. We proceed to derive theoretical properties of the proposed Gibbs sampler. We then demonstrate that the proposed Gibbs sampler is scalable to significantly higher dimensional problems as compared to using an accept-reject or a Metropolis-Hasting algorithm. Finally, we show the efficacy of the proposed approach on simulated and real data. "

"Tuesday, September 13, 2016",All Day,Spurlock Museum of World Cultures,Medieval Irish Masterpieces in Modern Reproduction Exhibition,"“Medieval Irish Masterpieces in Modern Reproduction” showcases two extraordinary University of Illinois collections of modern reproductions of medieval Irish art. The craft of metalworking is represented by two dozen superb electrotype facsimiles of jewelry and reliquaries such as the Tara Brooch and the Cross of Cong made by the firm of Dublin jeweler Edmond Johnson, originally for the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. The art of the scribe is illustrated by ten limited-edition facsimiles of medieval Irish manuscripts such as the Leabhar Breac and the Book of Kells published by learned societies such as the Royal Irish Academy and commercial presses such as Urs Graf Verlag. Most of these reproductions were acquired by the University in and around 1916, the year of the Irish “Easter Rising” against British rule. They celebrated Irish culture as part of an Irish Foundation envisioned by Gertrude Schoepperle, a noted Celtic scholar in the English Department. This centenary exhibit and symposium places these reproductions in relation to their medieval originals and in the modern context of the “Gaelic Revival” and the construction, imagination, and study of Irish cultural heritage and national identity in Ireland and America."

Mathews Ave., Urbana","Linguistics Seminar Series: Karlos Arregi, Associate Professor of Linguistics, Univ. of Chicago: ""Is Basque an ergative language?""","  Abstract: On the surface, Basque looks like an ergative language: Case morphology groups direct objects and (most) intransitive subjects together as unmarked absolutive, separate from transitive subjects, which have marked ergative case. However, its case system has so far defied satisfactory explanation, and the two most promising current theories of ergative cannot account for the distribution of this case in Basque subjects.    In the dependent case approach (i.a. Marantz 1991, Baker 2015), ergative is restricted to transitive subjects, as it is assigned to a nominal that c-commands another nominal in a sentence. However, many Basque intranisitive verbs govern ergative subjects, and attempts to reanalyze them as underlyingly transitive predicates have been shown to be wrong (i.a. Preminger 2012).    An alternative approach to ergative case claims that ergative is inherent, assigned specifically to external arguments (i.a. Woolford 1997, Legate 2008). This makes correct predictions for transitive subjects, which are typical external arguments, and also for many agent-like ergative intransitive subjects in Basque.   However, this entails that ergative cannot be assigned to derived subjects (since inherent case is by definition restricted to underived positions), which has been refuted in a number of recent works (most prominently, Rezac, Albizu, and Etxepare 2014).   In this talk, I propose that the so-called ergative case in Basque is in fact not the ergative case. Rather, the case that surfaces on transitive subjects is nominative of a special kind, labelled ""marked nominative"" in the typological literature (referring to the fact that, unlike most instances of nominative, the exponence of subject case in some languages is marked).    Specifically, I adopt Baker's (2015) analysis of marked nominative, according to which it is assigned in the clausal domain (TP) to a nominal that is not c-commanded by another nominal. In addition, I also adopt Baker's proposal that a clause has two case domains. The higher case domain is the clause itself (TP), and the lower one is VP.    Thus, a subject is assigned marked nominative if and only if it is the highest VP-external nominal in a clause. This predicts, correctly, that external arguments of transitive verbs have marked nominative, since they are generated VP-externally. While many intransitive subjects are VP-internal, others are VP-external (either by base-generation or movement), which explains why some intransitive subjects have marked nominative.  "

As evidence for this approach to ergative as marked nominative, I argue that it overcomes the difficulties for standard theories of ergative mentioned above. In a nutshell: Assignment of marked nominative is not dependent on the presence of a lower nominal, and it need not be assigned to a nominal in its base position. Furthermore, together with the claim that VP is a lower case domain in Basque, the analysis also makes correct predictions for the distribution of dative case in sentences with ditransitives, causatives, psych predicates, certain monotransitive predicates, and differential object marking (widely attested in substandard Basque, i.a. Rodriguez 2016)."

Building trust between all the stakeholders of a museum—from board to staff to community members—is about hearing what is most important from each perspective, and building meaningful links. In this talk, Laura will explore the realities of positioning a museum and cultural institution as a learning organization, while at the same time honoring heritage and facing a complex future. Dr. Laura Calamos Nasir earned her Ph.D. from King’s College London, England and she holds a postgraduatecertificate in academic practice. She is a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy with special teaching interests inlifelong learning, online delivery and experiential education. As an author, university lecturer and esteemed conference speaker across North America, Africa and Europe, Laura is internationally recognized for teaching advanced communication skills, teamwork and leadership. She has been on faculty at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill since 2003, and recently joined the adjunct faculty of the University of Illinois at Chicago. Engaging interdisciplinary groups every day, she works to develop meaningful processes in the co-creation of shared, continuous learning cultures, at work and in the community.  "

"Wednesday, April 05, 2017",4:00 pm,"AAS Conference Room, 1208 W Nevada, Urbana","Signs of the Times, or Rendering Semiotics Fashionable with a Little Help from David Henry Hwang","How does the costume become a sign? Whither sartorial semiosis? Asian American Studies scholars such Mimi Nguyen, Minh-Ha Pham, Vanita Reddy, Thuy Linh Tu, Denise Cruz and Sean Metzger have each written in various ways about costume, dress, and/or fashion as these terms animate Asian American studies. This fashionable turn responds in part to the renewed emphasis on the ways in which clothing matters for immigrant communities and within American media, more generally. Using playwright Henry David Hwang as a case study, I explore what a renewed investment in semiotics might yield for Asian American critique, in general, and Asian American performance studies in particular. Hwang occupies a singular position within Asian American performance, and he repeatedly returns to costume as a means to articulate transnational migratory routes that might sustain or contest ethnicized roots. The forms of dress circulating in Hwang’s theatre layer historical narratives that reveal or otherwise shape erotic and political desires as well as the norms that render those desires legible on stage. Sean Metzger is Associate Professor of School of Theater, Film and Television at UCLA. He works at the intersections of Asian American, Caribbean, Chinese, film, performance and sexuality studies. His first book, Chinese Looks: Fashion, Performance, Race, was published by Indiana University Press in 2014. From yellow-face performance in the 19th century to Jackie Chan in the 21st century, Chinese Looks examines articles of clothing and modes of adornment as a window on how American views of China have changed in the past 150 years. Metzger has also co-edited three collections of essays: Embodying Asian/American Sexualities with Gina Masequesmay (Lexington, 2009); Futures of Chinese Cinema: Technologies and Temporalities in Chinese Screen Cultures with Olivia Khoo (Intellect, 2009); Race, Space, Place: The Making and Unmaking of Freedoms in the Atlantic World with Michaeline Crichlow (a special issue of Cultural Dynamics, Nov. 2009). A fourth volume of essays entitled Islands, Images, Imaginaries co-edited with Francisco J. Hernández Adrián and Michaeline Crichlow, was published as a special issue of the journal Third Text in 2014."

Two standard classes of techniques for rank aggregation are: a) Combinatorial methods that pose the question as one of computing the median of a set of rankings under a suitable distance measure; such methods are agnostic and usually require solving hard computational problems. b) Model-based methods that assume some distribution of preferences and aim to provide probabilistic guarantees for the performance of aggregation algorithms for the given model only. We propose to merge these two approaches by combining new distance-based aggregation algorithms with probabilistic model analysis including the Mallows and a new family of generalized Mallows models. The gist of our method is to perform distance-based aggregation in a coded domain, where the codes are subdiagonal Mahonian representations of the rankings that allow for decoupling the positions in the rankings. The algorithmic solutions may be implemented in parallel and they run in time linear in the size of the list to be ranked and the number of available preferences. We applied our methods on a number of real datasets, and in particular, on data generated for gene prioritization studied in cancer genomics, where we showed improvements over the state-of-the art methods.

Sounds are used to convey meaning and emotion. Functional MRI studies have shed new light on how we process the emotional valence of sounds, especially non-speech sounds. In this talk, I will review studies from our lab and other labs about how the limbic network subserves the emotional processing of sounds, especially the nodes of amygdala, the insula and the parahippocampal gyrus. Such processing is altered in conditions of hearing loss or tinnitus ('ringing in the ears'). "

"Tuesday, May 02, 2017",3:30 pm,Eng 106B8,"Statistics Seminar - ""Stein's Method Applied to Some Statistical Problems"" Jay Bartroff, University of Southern California","Title: Stein's Method Applied to Some Statistical ProblemsAbstract: I will discuss two instances of applying Stein's powerful method of distributional approximation to statistical problems. First, in the setting of group sequential testing methods where accumulating data is evaluated intermittently in stages, an existing multivariate Berry-Esseen bound based on Stein's method is applied to the joint distribution of MLEs of a vector parameter at each group analysis to obtain explicit bounds to its limiting normal distribution. The setting is a general parametric regression setup which allows the i-th observation to be the i-th subject's (say) response regressed on their covariates. Second, new and improved concentration inequalities are obtained via Stein's method for a class of multivariate occupancy models whose marginal distributions are lattice log concave and satisfy some other weak conditions. Examples with a statistical flavor in this class include degree counts in a random graph, the number ofneighbors and the volume covered by multi-way intersections in germ-grain models, bin occupancy counts in the multinomial model, and population sizes under multivariate hypergeometric sampling. In these models the new method provides concentration inequalities having the Poisson tail rate, many of which improve on those achieved by competing methods."

A key aspect of racial equity is the role of higher education administrators in recognizing and facilitating a diverse campus which promotes and supports its faculty so that they can makecontributions to students, the campus, and the broader society. Thus, higher education administrators must be committed to cultivating the gifts and talents of all faculty,and particularly faculty of color who often encounter challenges in terms of recruitment and hiring, promotionand tenure, and mentoring. This talk will focus on some of the challenges faced by faculty of color, particularly in predominantly white institutions, and strategies for cultivating the gifts and talents of these faculty."

In the time of ubiquitous computing and pervasive archiving, it is time to calibrate the form, format, and functions of the digital turn. A decade ago, the value of digitization was in its capacity to provide non-material, virtual, portable copies of information sets which could be distributed and circulated with ease, thus driving the 'Open Everything' moments. However, now that we are not only inundated with digital copies but are also flooded with born digital objects that require new and often unprecedented forms of archiving and memory making, the question to ask is whether the promises and premises of the digital turn need to be critically examined. In this session, we propose that the original digital turn was predicated on an 'extinction' call that sought to store but forget, archive but 'unremember' the knowledge that was being addressed.

The first half of the session, understands this extinction call through the physical computation processes of data storage, migration, and activation, and proposes that we need a new call of 'survival' to mark the future of our digital practices. The second half draws from practices of curation, circulation, and creation to show how these might be brought to life. Building upon the new demands that Digital Humanities have offered to the role and relevance of the digital in our emerging practices, we move towards a new framework of understanding the post-digital moment that we occupy.

However, in many real data problems, e.g. in compressive sensing, signal processing and imaging, the response variables are nonlinear functions of the unknown parameters. In this talk I will introduce a so-called quadratic measurements regression model that extends the usual linear model. We study the Lq regularized least squares method for variable selection and establish its weak oracle property. Moreover, we derive a fixed point equation and use it to construct an algorithm for numerical optimization. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and the efficiency of the algorithm. This is a joint work with J. Fan, L. Kong and N. Xiu.  "

Offerman is a 1993 graduate of the U. of I. in theatre. A native of Minooka, Ill., Offerman learned basic carpentry from his father. He used these skills in building sets in the scene shop at the U. of I. While a theatre student, Offerman enrolled in a Kabuki theater class taught by Shozo Sato, the founder of the U. of I.’s Japan House and a professor emeritus of art and design. He flourished in the class and became close to Sato, traveling to Japan with Sato's Kabuki troupe.   After graduating, Offerman moved to Chicago, where he and a group of U. of I. students founded the Defiant Theatre, an experimental acting company. Offerman continued to build scenery and props for large unionized theaters to supplement his meager acting income.   Offerman began earning feature film roles and bit spots on TV shows, including “ER,” “24,” “Deadwood,” “The West Wing,” “Will & Grace,” “NYPD Blue” and “Gilmore Girls.” He also continued work as a carpenter, building cabins and decks.

These losses were the devastating consequences of the two world wars, revolutions, famines, genocidal campaigns, and purges that wracked Europe in the first half of the twentieth century and spread new ideas, created new political and economic systems, and crafted new identities.   Drawing from his book, Total Wars and the Making of Modern Ukraine, 1914–1954, George O. Liber argues that the continuous violence of the world wars and interwar years transformed the Ukrainian-speaking population of East Central Europe into self-conscious Ukrainians. Wars, mass killings, and forced modernization drives made and re-made Ukraine’s boundaries, institutionalized its national identities, and pruned its population according to various state-sponsored political, racial, and social ideologies. In short, the two world wars, the Holodomor, and the Holocaust played critical roles in forming today’s Ukraine."

Traveling alongside Kochetov were the Russian Minister of Finance, Sergei Witte, and the cultural entrepreneur and owner of the Moscow-Yaroslavl Railroad Company—Savva Mamontov. The following year, Kochetov published his travelogue On the Frozen Sea: A Journey to the North [Po studenomu moryu: poezdka na sever], which described his impressions from the journey and expressed his hopes for the future of the northern regions. Kochetov's rich account, issued through the publishing house of Savva's older brother, also contained thirty drawings made by Konstantin Korovin and Valentin Serov during their travels to the north.   This Noontime Scholars Lecture focuses on these men's journey to the high north and its literary and artistic depictions, found in Kochetov's travelogue. The lecture argues that the journey reflects how material interests in the northern parts of Russia and Scandinavia correlate with artistic production and, by extension, the making of an aesthetic of the north.   Ingrid C. Nordgaard is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures at Yale University. She received a B.A. in Russian Language and Literature from Tromsø University, Norway (2010), and an M.A. in Russian Studies from New York University (2013). In her dissertation project, ""Aesthetics of the North: Russian Modernist Culture and Scandinavia, 1891–1910,"" Nordgaard discusses how aesthetic representations of the north—both as an imagined geography and as a true geographical location—must be contextualized and explained within the larger narratives that characterize the period, regarding capitalism, nationalism, questions of socio-economic development, and modernity at large."

An in-depth examination of the Miriskusniki’s specific ideologies, subjects chosen, and artistic styles indicates that these artists utilized their talents to depict pressing domestic concerns and to portray Russia’s relationship to Western Europe. Moreover, the tension between the Miriskusniki’s and the Peredvizhniki’s supporters attests to the Miriskusniki’s instrumental role in offering powerful and influential visual commentaries about their country’s immediate concerns and long-term development. The World of Art exhibitions, 1898-1906, demonstrate that some Miriskusniki’s creations embody competing notions of political and national identity, thereby serving as visual accounts of late tsarist Russia’s vibrant arts and contentious politics.   Cadra Peterson McDaniel is an Assistant Professor of History/Liberal Studies at Texas A&M University-Central Texas. She is the Coordinator for the Master of Science in Liberal Studies program, and the faculty sponsor for Phi Alpha Theta. Her primary areas of interest include Russian and European foreign affairs and culture in the late 19th century and the 20th century. Also, she is interested in contemporary Russian foreign policy. Among her publications is the book, American-Soviet Cultural Diplomacy: The Bolshoi Ballet’s American Premiere. Currently, she is researching the intersection of the visual arts and politics in late tsarist Russia."

Unfortunately, these data are often siloed, each with their own restrictions that severely limits access to individual data and generally prevents federation and value-added analysis. With the growth of data science, our peers have demonstrated that these data hold great promise to revolutionize how Universities operate. As a result, we are holding a University Data Summit to publicize the different types of data available within our university, to discuss how we might overcome challenges that limit access or use, and to brainstorm about tools and analyses that relevant stakeholders would like to see developed. As a specific example, just as companies spend a considerable amount of money to improve targeted ads in online settings, we could use a similar approach to aid in recruitment of a diverse and inclusive student body, to identify and assist at-risk students earlier in the process, and to more effectively tailor alumni engagement.

Since last spring we have been in conversation with many of you about the information, resources and problem-solving tools we need to do just that. Thanks to the generosity of faculty, staff and students who have committed their time and energy to helping us map the day, we have organized two dozen presentations that address many of the issues scholars in the humanities and related fields grapple with as both individual scholars and as a set of interdependent communities at Illinois.The program and schedule can be seen at the humanities retreat website.   In order to plan for catering and space allocation we are asking you to pre-register for the day’s events here using the online pre-registration form. The deadline for pre-registration is August 11, 2017.   For the full Humanities Retreat schedule and session descriptions, please see the Humanities Retreat website."

Frees, University of Wisconsin-Madison","In the first portion of the talk I discuss the importance of modeling dependencies among insurance risks. I set the stage for this by describing various risk control mechanisms that the insurer has at its disposal and use this platform for describing the types of associations that are of concern to insurers. To model dependencies, I focus on the use of a copula, a probabilistic tool widely used in insurance and other disciplines.   The second portion of the talk, on ""Customer Loyalty and Risk in Personal Insurance,"" is joint work with Catalina Bolancé, Montserrat Guillén, and Emiliano Valdez. This work connects two strands of research on modeling personal (automobile and homeowners) insurance. One strand involves understanding the joint outcomes of separate personal insurance contracts, e.g., do higher automobile claims suggest more severe homeowner claims? A second strand of the literature involves understanding determinants of customer loyalty. For example, we now know that when a customer cancels one insurance contract, he or she is likely to cancel all other contracts soon after. We use copula regression to model the joint outcomes of auto and home claims as well as customer loyalty. Including customer loyalty, or duration with the company, is complicated because of the censoring of this time variable as well as the discreteness. Although customers may cancel the contract at any time, cancellation typically occurs at contract renewal, making this variable essentially a discrete outcome. Composite likelihood and generalized method of moments techniques allow us to address the special features of this data structure."

Despite its popularity in applied sciences, its theoretical properties are largely unknown. In this paper, we use a connection between envelope models and partial least squares (PLS) to construct an envelope-based SPLS estimator and establish its consistency, oracle property and asymptotic normality. Large-sample scenario and high-dimensional scenario are both addressed. We also derived the envelope-based SPLS estimators under the context of generalized linear models, and discussed its theoretical properties including consistency, oracle property and asymptotic distribution. Our numerical experiments show that the envelope-based SPLS estimator has a better selection and prediction performance over the SPLS estimator in literature. Examples are provided for illustration.

While many factors contribute to this variation (e.g., sociolinguistic, physiological), there is considerable evidence that acoustic-phonetic variation is highly structured among speech sounds. Structured variation of this type can be observed in the covariation among vowels in the F1xF2 vowel space, as talkers form relatively congruent, but shifted vowel spaces (e.g., Joos, 1948; Nearey, 1978), as well as in the covariation of talker mean voice onset time among aspirated stop consonants (e.g., Chodroff & Wilson, 2017). The presence of covariation reveals constraints on permissible variation in language- and talker-specific sound systems (e.g., Liljencrants & Lindblom, 1972), and may be exploited in generalized perceptual adaptation to novel talkers.   In this talk, I will examine the predictions of two constraints on phonetic implementation that could give rise to covariation across talkers. The constraints are formalized as target uniformity, which requires similar (or identical) phonetic realization of a distinctive feature value within a talker, and contrast uniformity, which requires a comparable phonetic difference in sounds that contrast in a feature across talkers. Evidence from several case studies of sibilant fricatives implicates target uniformity, but not necessarily contrast uniformity as a constraint on phonetic realization.    I will also discuss the implications of phonetic covariation for perceptual adaptation to novel talkers. Covariation indicates mutual predictability among speech sounds, such that evidence from one speech sound could be used to infer properties of a second speech sound, even without direct exposure. I present evidence that perceptual knowledge of phonetic covariation is consistent with many patterns of generalized adaptation, but general auditory factors (e.g., spectral contrast) may have primary influence on short-term adaptation.   Eleanor Chodroff recently received her PhD in Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins University. She is now a Post-Doc in the Linguistics Department at Northwestern University.  Her CV can be found either at her website or here as a .pdf.   "

Faculty and students who have found a home within the department also have links to a wide range of language and literature programs including German, French and Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, Slavic, East Asian Studies, Linguistics, and English, as well as Cinema and Media Studies, Religion, Jewish Studies, The Center for South Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, Gender and Women’s Studies and Philosophy. Just as we have been informed by these fields we have also informed them.   On the 50th Anniversary of the inauguration of the Program, and the 150th Anniversary of the founding of the University, we want to recognize these important historical milestones and the wide ranging contribution that CWL has made to the School of Languages, Cultures and Linguistics and outside the building to the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. In recognition of this we are hosting a symposium “CWL @ 50: Comparative and World Literature in Historical Perspective”.   This two day event brings together current faculty and students with alumni who have continued the work they began in CWL in a wide variety of departments and institutions throughout North America and beyond. Through a series of panels and papers we hope to reflect on and celebrate the intellectual development of the field, showcasing the wide array of trends and strengths that our program fosters.   Our keynote speaker Haun Saussey (University of Chicago) will offer a graduate workshop on the afternoon of the first day of the program, followed by dinner and a keynote in the evening that is open to the public. Michael Palencia Roth one of the founders of the original program will offer welcome remarks.   The second day brings together 6 scholars who were formerly connected to the program with 6 scholars who are current members of it. There will be four panels over the course of the day during which faculty will present their research and consider future directions for the field."

Controversies have formed around foreign influence on commodified popular music forms, the relationship between those forms and “the people”, and music as a business enterprise. Rap, when it emerged on the Brazilian mainstream scene in the late 1990s, was seen as an adaptation of foreign cultural forms. This presentation argues that it has become part of the Brazilian popular music tradition and discusses how that happened and what changes it brought to that tradition."

Natural history owes much to the tradition of assembling cabinets of curiosity in which natural specimens were collected alongside objects with geological, ethnographic, and artistic significance. In this period, the refinement of printed images revolutionized the observational sciences. Increasingly sophisticated woodcuts and eventually engravings, which could be augmented with hand coloring, largely superseded hand-drawn images, more crude woodcuts, and verbal descriptions in scientific publications, while also appealing to artists and art lovers."

"Monday, October 02, 2017",4:00 - 5:00 pm,"FLB 1080, Lucy Ellis Lounge",Linguistics Seminar Series - Presentation by Itxaso Rodríguez-Ordóñez,"Does language contact lead to complexification or simplification? evidence from Basque   Abstract:   The debate as to whether contact leads to language simplification or complexification (Dahl, 2004; Miestamo et al., 2008; McWhorter, 2011; Gardani et al., 2015) has often been linked to the type of contact involved. Studies suggest that simplification is prone in adult L2-learning situations (Kusters, 2003; Bentz & Winter, 2013; Sorace, 2011) whereas cases of complexification are prone in long-term intensive contact settings or in child-bilingualism (Trudgill, 2011). Studies wherein both populations co-exist, however, remain underexplored. In this presentation, I examine three features of Basque within the Basque Autonomous Community in Spain, where Basque has been in long-standing contact with Spanish and where a large Basque-L2 community has emerged as a result of recent revitalization efforts (1960-80s).   The three contact-phenomena of interest are Basque Differential Object Marking (DOM), ergative case-marking in the nominal inflection and subject pronoun expression (SPE). Following a variationist approach, a total of 84 Basque-Spanish bilinguals were stratified in 4 groups (native Basque-Spanish, early sequential bilinguals (ESB), L2-advanced and L2-intermediate Basque learners). The variable use of the three phenomena were coded for a number of linguistic factors established in the literature and submitted to a hierarchy constraint analysis, followed by mixed-effects models, in R.    Following the relative approach to complexification, I argue that Basque DOM among L2 speakers arose to lessen the processing cost among these bilinguals (Kusters, 2003; Hawkins, 2004), but constitutes a case of linguistic complexification with respect to the functional use of the dative case marker (Dahl, 2004). Results for ergative case-marking show ample variation in its lack of use depending on the type of speaker: native-bilinguals show a phonological effect, whereas L2 speakers present a ‘problem’ in its interfaces. I argue that the underuse of ergative is the result of a simplification process in paradigmatic redundancy (i.e. case), constituting an “L2-difficult” feature (Dahl, 2004: 294), for which learners need to figure out the way different interfaces interact in constraining its use. In terms of SPE, results show that higher rates of SPE among low proficiency speakers of Basque could be attributed to L2 speakers’ need to alleviate processing costs. However, the internal configuration among these speakers is argued not to be the result of constraint simplification nor constitutes a problem in discourse-pragmatic interfaces, but is rather explained as form of complexification that is promoted by transfer effects from Spanish. In conclusion, this presentation puts into question the tendency to equate bilinguals’ processing costs to linguistic simplification.   Itxaso received her Ph.D. in Hispanic Linguistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2016. Her research focuses on the mechanisms that emerge in contact situations and lead to typologically common and uncommon linguistic patterns.    Her work on contact-induced linguistic phenomena falls within the intersection between sociolinguistics, typology, and language acquisition. Additionally, she incorporates linguistic attitudes and ideologies to explain mechanisms of contact-induced change. Most of her work pertains to the Basque-Spanish contact situation in Spain. She has done work on the acquisition of Basque ergativity and contact effects in Basque subject pronoun expression and pitch-accents in Gernika Basque. More recently, she has also focused on contact effects in the Linguistic Landscapes of Spanish and English in Pilsen, Chicago.

In this paper, an automated process is used to register large-magnitude deformations in the horizontal and vertical dimensions of sagittal ultrasound images of the tongue. Resulting lingual velocity functions are consistent with the hypothesis that vowels are not entirely deleted when they devoice; instead, they overlap with the preceding consonant.

More significantly, why is spectatorial attention focused on this enigmatic kneeler rather than the eminent buddhas he worships? Examining the visual program of this mesmerizing grotto and the kneeling figure’s place therein, this paper argues that the cave creates an idealized representation of a space of Buddhist ritual practice. Within this space, the kneeler, a figure that finds no exact counterpart in scriptural sources, comes both to enact perpetual reverence on behalf of absent worshippers and to solicit spectatorial identification; he thereby enables viewers to imagine themselves into the representational world of scriptural narrative and liturgical practice constructed in the cave. Drawing on Hans Belting’s recent work on image anthropology, this paper concludes by interrogating the triangular relationship among illusion, matter, and the mind that is thematized in the grotto. The cave, its source texts, and related rituals collectively seem to insist on the fundamental irrelevance of all media save the mind itself—which, I argue, points to the need to develop a specifically Buddhist theory of images, media, and bodies.   Phillip E. Bloom is Curator of the Chinese Garden and Director of the Center for East Asian Garden Studies, The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, San Marino, CA. Most recently Assistant Professor of East Asian art at Indiana University, Bloom holds his Ph.D. from Harvard University in the history of art and architecture. His research interests include Chinese Buddhist art of Tang (618-907) and Song (960-1279) dynasties, theories of art and ritual, as well as the artistic and religious exchanges among the cultures of medieval East Asia.

Natural history owes much to the tradition of assembling cabinets of curiosity in which natural specimens were collected alongside objects with geological, ethnographic, and artistic significance. In this period, the refinement of printed images revolutionized the observational sciences. Increasingly sophisticated woodcuts and eventually engravings, which could be augmented with hand coloring, largely superseded hand-drawn images, more crude woodcuts, and verbal descriptions in scientific publications, while also appealing to artists and art lovers."

It will analyze the concept of anthropophagy, developed by Tarsila and her contemporaries, in the production of Brazilian artists from different areas, such as Chico Buarque, Ney Matogrosso, Hélio Oiticica and Rubem Fonseca. For this, it compares some paintings by Tarsila with fragments of later works from Brazilian cultural scene, in addition to showing the impact of the painter's work on contemporary Brazilian cultural imagery. It will be possible to see, then, how the production of Tarsila do Amaral left a great trace in the Brazilian culture, that extends by the plastic arts, literature, cinema, television and even mass culture.

In contrast, much of the literature simply focuses on algorithms for maximizing accuracy. With the increasing integration of machine learning into real systems, it is clear that accuracy is an insufficient measure of performance for many problems of interest. Unfortunately, unlike accuracy, many real world performance metrics are non-decomposable i.e. cannot be computed as a sum of losses for each instance. Thus, known algorithms and associated analysis are not trivially extended, and direct approaches require expensive combinatorial optimization. I will outline recent results characterizing population optimal classifiers for large families of binary and multilabel classification metrics, including such nonlinear metrics as F-measure and Jaccard measure. Perhaps surprisingly, the prediction which maximizes the utility for a range of such metrics takes a simple form. This results in simple and scalable procedures for optimizing complex metrics in practice. Time permitting, I will briefly outline how the same analysis gives decision-theoretic optimal procedures for selecting point estimates from complex posterior distributions for structured objects such as graphs.

"Friday, November 03, 2017",12:00 - 1:30 pm,"Lucy Ellis Lounge, 1080 Foreign Language Building (707 S. Mathews Ave, Urbana)","Erin Aeran Chung, CEAPS Speaker, ""Immigrant Incorporation in East Asian Democracies""","  Until the early 2000s, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan shared restrictive immigration policies, descent-based nationality laws, and exclusionary practices toward immigrants. These analogous policies and practices, however, generated dramatically divergent patterns of immigrant incorporation from the mid-2000s. In Korea, the arrival of migrant labor fueled centralized rights-based movements and, eventually, national-level rights-based legislation. Although few structural reforms followed the arrival of recent immigrants to Japan, social welfare provisions for foreign residents already settled within Japan are among the most generous of industrial democracies. Finally, while Taiwan was the first among the three countries to implement a guest worker program in 1989, it has been the slowest in addressing immigrant rights and welfare, labor protections for migrant workers, and local support services for foreign residents.   How do we explain divergent patterns of immigrant incorporation in Korea, Japan, and Taiwan given the similarities between each country’s immigration and citizenship policies, their overlapping immigrant populations largely from neighboring Asian countries, and their common dilemmas of accommodating social diversity while adhering to liberal democratic principles? Based on in-depth interviews with immigrants, pro-immigrant activists, and government officials, focus groups with the major foreign resident groups in all three countries, and questionnaires, this book prioritizes the role played by civil society actors—including migrants themselves—in giving voice to migrant interests, mobilizing migrant actors, and shaping public debate and policy on immigration. Departing from the dominant scholarship on immigrant incorporation that focuses on national cultures or traditions, domestic political elites, and international norms, I argue that civil society actors drew on existing strategies previously applied to incorporate historically marginalized groups, or what I call civic legacies, to confront the challenges of immigrant incorporation. Rather than determining the paths available to later generations, civic legacies provide civil society actors with ideas, networks, and strategies for making claims to the state, swaying public opinion, organizing activists, and building networks between and among state and non-state actors. As the first English-language book comparing three countries that represent a single model of immigrant incorporation in East Asia, Immigrant Incorporation in East Asian Democracies proposes to shed insights into the gaps between policy intent, interpretation, and outcomes.   Erin Aeran Chung is the Charles D. Miller Associate Professor of East Asian Politics in the Department of Political Science and the Co-Director of the Racism, Immigration, and Citizenship (RIC) Program at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. She specializes in East Asian political economy, international migration, and comparative racial politics. She has been a Mansfield Foundation U.S.-Japan Network for the Future Program Scholar (2012-2014), an SSRC Abe Fellow at the University of Tokyo (2009-2010) and Korea University (2010), an advanced research fellow at Harvard University's Weatherhead Center for International Affairs Program on U.S.-Japan Relation (2003-2004), and a Japan Foundation fellow at Saitama University (1998-1999). Her first book, Immigration and Citizenship in Japan, was published by Cambridge University Press in 2010 and translated into Japanese and published by Akashi Shoten in 2012. She is currently completing her second book, Immigrant Incorporation in East Asian Democracies, under contract at Cambridge University Press.  "

Miller Auditorium (B102 CLSL),"Biochemistry Seminar: Dr. Christopher Brett (Concordia University), ""The ILF Pathway: Master Controller of Lysosomal Transporter Protein Lifetimes ""","Everyone recycles for health and longevity – at least from the perspective cell biologists. This is because all eukaryotic cells, including the trillions that constitute you and I, rely on organelles called lysosomes to recycle biomaterials. This activity provides cells with nutrients upon starvation and clears toxic biomaterials that accumulate with age. Underlying these functions are specialized proteins within their membrane that mobilize nutrients and control cell aging and metabolic programs. Defects in these transporter proteins are associated with metabolic and age-related disorders, such as cancers and Alzheimer’s disease. Despite their importance, we know little about lysosomal transporter proteins lifetimes or how they are regulated. Until recently, when my group discovered a new process in S. cerevisiae called the IntraLumenal Fragment (ILF) pathway: In response to misfolding, substrate levels or Target Of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling, lysosomal transporter proteins are sorted into an area of membrane between docked organelles that is internalized within the lumen and degraded upon membrane fusion. Using cell-free assays, tractable genetics, quantitative morphometrics and live cell microscopy, we have begun to uncover the molecular basis of this fundamental cellular process and its role in metabolism, aging and cell death. As the underlying machinery is evolutionarily conserved, we speculate that the ILF pathway plays an important role in human cell aging and metabolism."

The scene is set in Fukagawa in the Edo period, with Eikichi (Uchino Masaaki), a tofu maker who comes from Kyo to Edo, and his Edo-born wife, Ofumi (Nakatani Miki). It portrays the checkered life of the couple from the perspective of the bond between a husband and a wife.   Eikichi, having trained at an established tofu maker in Kyo, comes to a traditional town of Fukagawa Hamaguri-cho in Edo to open his own shop, where he meets Ofumi, a true-born Fukagawa girl full of life. With the help of Ofumi's father, Eikichi finds accommodation at the same tenement as Ofumi. Eikichi finally opens ""Kyo-ya"", his long-planned Tofu shop of his own. Eikichi and Ofumi get married before long and build a home together. The business thrives, but their eldest son, who becomes tired of Tofu making, gets involved with gambling. The shop is taken over by another tofu maker as payment for debts, and the family is on the brink of disintegration. To make matters worse, Eikichi suddenly dies in an accident. Remembering that Tofu making was Eikichi's life, Ofumi and the children decide to protect Kyo-ya. (Directed by Masaki Hamamoto. 2007. 120 min.)   This screening is part of the 13th Japan Foundation Film Series made possible by the generous support of the Japan Foundation.  "

Gregory St., Urbana","Archaeological Institute of America Lecture Series - Andrew Goldman, Department of History, Gonzaga University (Renner Lecture): ""Helmets from the Sea: Military Finds from the Battle of the Aegates Islands (24BCE)""","Dr. Andrew L. Goldman has been a member of the Gonzaga University History Department since the fall semester of 2002. His fields of special interest are ancient history (Roman and Greek), classical archaeology, and the classical languages (Latin and Greek). He received his BA from Wesleyan University in 1988, and his MA and PhD degrees from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill in 1993 and 2000. He has spent several years living and teaching abroad: he lived in Ankara, Turkey, as a Fulbright Fellow and instructor at Bilkent University (1995-97), and in Rome as a teacher at Duke University’s Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies (1999-2000). On March 10, 241 BCE, the final naval battle of the First Punic War was fought off western Sicily, where a large Roman fleet engaged an equally large Carthaginian fleet near the Aegates Islands. The ancient historian Polybius tells us how the Romans won a decisive victory and forced the Carthaginians to sue for peace shortly thereafter. Almost 2300 years later, the site of the battle has been located off Levanzo Island (in the modern Egadi Islands group), and its landscape has been carefully surveyed by RPM Nautical Foundation and Sicily’s Soprintendenza del Mare. By the end of 2014, 11 warship rams, 8 helmets and a wide scatter of artifacts had been recorded on the sea floor, at the first maritime battlefield from ancient times which has ever been explored.   This lecture will discuss the ancient battle as we understand it from surviving literary sources like Polybius and will present what the new archaeological finds have revealed about the conflict and its combatants, the early legionaries of Rome and the mercenary forces of Carthage. Fieldwork at this maritime site has not only produced some of the earliest Latin inscriptions and Roman iconographic representations ever discovered, but also a series of helmets of the early Montefortino type, what are arguably the most successful piece of equipment ever developed, in use for nearly 500 years. These mid-3rd century BCE finds are not only helping us to understand the use and production of Roman armor, but are also permitting us to reexamine the development of the Roman military during its most important, formative years under the Republic. In addition, one of the newly recovered helmets is likely to be of Carthaginian origin, a discovery that is providing new insight into how Rome’s greatest ancient adversary once waged war.  "

During WWII, “more than a million men were taken from Korea to labor at sites across Japanese and the South Pacific Islands; over 200,000 of them were sent to Hokkaido.”(Byung-ho Chung) Many died in harsh conditions in the foreign land. In 2015, 70 years after the war’s end, a group of international volunteers, led by Japanese priest Yoshikiho and Korean scholar Byun-ho Chung, repatriated 115 victim remains to South Korea.

They are also important for industrial separations, and are being considered for applications involving catalysis and sensing. Biological membranes are an ideal model for synthetic membranes as they possess unique properties such as high transport and high selectivity at levels far beyond what is achievable in current membrane systems. After a short overview of our lab, this talk will discuss the current state of desalination membranes, and then focus on our work in this area. It will discuss our approach to conducting research in this area using two examples. Both examples build on fundamentals, but the first takes a longer term view of the challenges while the second focuses on rapidly implementable innovations that can make step changes in efficiencies of current membranes. The first project discussed will be the development of channel-based membranes that are inspired by biological membranes. It will discuss the project’s emergence from a detailed understanding of the structure-function properties of water channel proteins - aquaporins. The second project will report on the ongoing work in our lab on the development of the first scalable technique to eliminate concentration polarization in solute rejecting membranes.

Natural history owes much to the tradition of assembling cabinets of curiosity in which natural specimens were collected alongside objects with geological, ethnographic, and artistic significance. In this period, the refinement of printed images revolutionized the observational sciences. Increasingly sophisticated woodcuts and eventually engravings, which could be augmented with hand coloring, largely superseded hand-drawn images, more crude woodcuts, and verbal descriptions in scientific publications, while also appealing to artists and art lovers."

There is, however, deep disagreement as to whether justice is achieved with alternate measures such as amnesty or a truth commission. I argue that transitional justice is not aimed at giving perpetrators what they deserve, but rather is aimed at transforming a society in a just manner. Multiple kinds of processes can contribute to this transformation. After defining transitional justice, I then discuss the place of the EU in transitional justice.

The result was a massive increase in new literature characterized by a strong thematic engagement with Classical Greek literary texts and written in a stylized form of Greek modeled on the dialect used in Classical Athens some 500 years earlier. This use of the past, while widespread, tended to focus on a relatively narrow set of texts and to exhibit a shallow analysis of the meaning of important events. Historians as a group appear to have taken exception to this lack of rigor, and their combative attitude towards contemporary literature represents a backlash against common practice and an alternative strategy for building an intellectual persona. This talk will explore some of the ways historians claimed authoritative status through the study of past events, and, by dominating an intellectual arena valued for its social prestige, styled themselves the only worthy successors to their Classical antecedents.

The northern margins of Bahia’s cacao zone are characterized by dense tropical forest, steep hills, and heavy rainfall. Throughout the 19th and earlier centuries, these aspects of the region’s geography made it a frequent refuge for escaped slaves. In the first decades of the 20th century, these same forests offered space where former slaves could rebuild their lives. This was the case until plantation capital breached the region in the 1950s at the hands of one of Brazil’s most infamous capitalists, Norberto Odebrecht. By the end of the 20th century, the forests that remained in the region provided cover for landless families seeking land for themselves apart from the plantations. Across these historical periods, the forests that persisted at the margins of southern Bahia’s plantation economies provided refuge for people seeking to rebuild their lives. Scholars have often remarked upon these flights into forest, but the forest is typically viewed as a mere backdrop in slaves’ struggles for recognition. This talk reconsiders the forest as an active and sublime power. By escaping outside the bounds of Bahia’s plantation economies, free and former slaves unleashed the levelling power of the forest upon their masters’ asymmetrical claims to power and ownership over human and other nature."

The theme of this presentation is to study risk management in the presence of basis risk under two settings: index insurance design and dynamic longevity hedge. In the first part of the talk, we study the problem of index insurance design under an expected utility maximization framework. We formally prove the existence and uniqueness of optimal contract for general utility functions, and obtain analytical expressions of the optimal indemnity function for exponential utility and quadratic utility functions. Our method is illustrated by a numerical example where weather index insurance is designed for protection against the adverse rice yield using temperature and precipitation as the underlying indexes. When compared to the linear-type contracts that have been advocated in the literature, the empirical results show that our proposed index-based contract is more efficient at reducing farmers’ basis risk. In the second part of the talk, from a pension plan sponsor’s perspective, we study dynamic hedging strategies for longevity risk using standardized securities in a discrete-time setting. The hedging securities are linked to a population which may differ from the underlying population of the pension plan, and thus basis risk arises. Drawing from the technique of dynamic programming, we develop a framework which allows us to obtain analytical optimal dynamic hedging strategies to achieve the minimum variance of hedging error. Extensive numerical experiments show that our hedging method significantly outperforms the standard “delta” hedging strategy which is commonly studied in the literature.  Short Bio: Jingong Zhang is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Waterloo. His research interests focus on time-consistent planning, longevity risk management and agriculture insurance. He is an Associate of the Society of Actuaries, and a Society of Actuaries James C.

Water resources development has been supporting the blossom of the economy in China, but unfortunately the development ended with drying rivers and “closed” river basins, shrinking or disappearing lakes, depleted aquifers and degraded water and soil quality. Such unexpected changes have pushed a new round of policy and technology changes in China’s water management. During the period of 1950’s to 1970’s, water resources development followed a slogan of “human power over nature.” “Advancing with time” (yu-shi-zhu-jin), the slogan is now replaced by “human-nature harmony,” originating from the Taoism philosophy, recognizing the value of ecosystem restoration. Although large, centralized engineering projects are still under planning and construction, small-scale, distributed watershed management projects are taking a more important role. A transition from engineering-based water management to resource-based water management has been initialized with a wider focus on water as a distinct natural, human, and ecological resource. Moreover the institution formerly dominated by governmental administration is now changing to a combined government-market context. Nevertheless, China is facing several unique water management issues, such as extensive water pollution, rapidly growing urban water demand, drainage management in giant cities, constructing and managing large-scale water transfer projects and hydropower plants, large-scale soil conservation in Loess Plateau, etc. These outstanding issues call for further changes in water management institution and practices in the country. This talk discusses the ongoing and expected changes in water management in a changing China.   Professor Ximing Cai is the Colonel Harry F. and Frankie M. Lovell Endowed Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His current research areas include coupled human-natural system analysis with an emphasis on human interferences in hydrological processes, water-energy-food system modeling especially in dry areas, and sustainable water resources management particularly in developing countries."

Our knowledge on the mechanisms of cell motility originates primarily from studies using unconfined, two-dimensional (2D) substrates. However, these 2D assays fail to recapitulate the confining tracks encountered in vivo. Thus, we have engineered in vitro models to study cell motility in confining channels of different stiffness. This presentation will focus on the plasticity of cancer cell migration mechanisms, and how cells sense, adapt and respond to different physical microenvironments.

Through the study of book titles, tables of contents, prefaces, and postscripts in twenty-two pre-Tang poetry anthologies compiled in the 1500s, I identify three types of anthologizing practices. By employing quantitative and network analysis, I historicize these practices, investigate the motivations for the anthologies, and explore their citation networks. These anthologizing practices gradually transformed the classification principles of previous anthologies, expanded the scope of canonized anthologies, and established a distinct pre-Tang tradition by the end of the sixteenth century.

In its theoretical analysis, the book illuminates four alternative political agendas for the work and play of the mind, as they unfold through different processes for becoming property. These four “propertyscapes” represent competing visions for social life, framing projects for collective political action that are at times competing, at times overlapping. The key question of the book is whose property is the work and play of the mind?

We might not have cookies for all, but we guarantee you will have fun!"

"Tuesday, December 12, 2017",4:00 pm,245 Altgeld,"Actuarial Science Seminar - Edward Furman, York University - ""Weighted Insurance Pricing Model: Gini Shortfall, economic pricing and capital adequacy""","The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) fetched the Nobel Prize in Economics to Professor William Sharpe back in 1990. Speaking briefly, the CAPM offers a very simple expression to price an asset in a portfolio of assets, and the just-mentioned expression is magically free of the preferences of the involved investors. As the preferences are generally unobserved in reality, and due to the appealing simplicity of the end-result, the CAPM has become one of the most influential pricing models in finance today. In this talk, among other things, I will discuss the reasons for the CAPM's low penetration into the theory of actuarial pricing, and I will then offer an insurance variant of the model. I will show how a fairly general initial set-up can yield—akin to the Sharpe's CAPM case—simple pricing expressions for a large class of risks that are symmetric or non-symmetric, light-tailed or heavy-tailed, independent or dependent. This talk hinges on a number of joint works with Professors Alexey Kuznetsov (York), Ruodu Wang (Waterloo) and Ricardas Zitikis (Western)."
