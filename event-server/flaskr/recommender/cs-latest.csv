"Wednesday, April 18, 2018",10:00 am,2405 Thomas M. Siebel Center for Computer Science,"Jinguri He: ""Taming Data Heterogeneity: Towards a Unified Framework""","Abstract: Data heterogeneity is common across many high-impact application domains, ranging from national security to air traffic modeling, manufacturing, and healthcare. It is at the core of the 'Variety' aspect of big data. Such heterogeneity can be present in a variety of forms, including (1) task heterogeneity, where multiple related learning tasks can be jointly learned to improve the overall performance; (2) view heterogeneity, where complementary information is available from various sources; (3) oracle heterogeneity, where multiple oracles may have different opinions regarding the true label of an example; and (4) instance heterogeneity, where a single example can be decomposed into a set of instances with heterogeneous labels.    In this talk, I will present our recent work towards building a unified framework for learning from such data heterogeneity, focusing on the co-existence of multiple types of data heterogeneity such as task and oracle dual heterogeneity. The goal is to enable the learning model to enjoy the best of all possible worlds. In particular, I will hinge on the application of accident phase classification in air traffic modeling, discuss the problem-specific data heterogeneity, and our proposed tensor-based model for learning from such data heterogeneity, together with empirical results on various data sets. Finally, I will conclude the talk by sharing my vision for heterogeneous learning in the future.   Bio: Dr. Jingrui He is an assistant professor in School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering at Arizona State University. She received her Ph.D in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 2010, and joined ASU in 2014. Her research focuses on heterogeneous machine learning, rare category analysis, active learning and semi-supervised learning, with applications in social network analysis, healthcare, financial fraud detection, and manufacturing processes. Dr. He is the recipient of the 2016 NSF CAREER Award, two times recipient of the IBM Faculty Award in 2015 and 2014 respectively, and was selected as IJCAI 2017 Early Career Spotlight. She has published more than 70 refereed articles, and is the author of the book on Analysis of Rare Categories (Springer-Verlag, 2011). Her papers have been selected as Bests of the Conference by ICDM 2016, ICDM 2010, and SDM 2010. Dr. He has served on the senior or general program committees of many international conferences, including KDD, IJCAI, AAAI, SDM, and ICML. http://faculty.engineering.asu.edu/jingruihe/ "

Siebel Center for Computer Science,"Huacheng Yu: ""Better understanding of efficient dynamic data structures""","Abstract: Data structures have applications and connections to algorithm design, database systems, streaming algorithms and other areas of computer science. Understanding what efficient data structures can do (and what they cannot do) is crucial to these applications. In this talk, I will present my work in analyzing efficient data structures and proving what they cannot accomplish. I will focus on the recent development in building new connections between dynamic data structures and communication complexity, as well as a new approach to analyzing dynamic data structures with Boolean outputs and super-logarithmic time.   Bio: Huacheng Yu is a postdoctoral researcher in the Theory of Computing group at Harvard University. He obtained his PhD from Stanford University in 2017 under the supervision of Ryan Williams. He also holds a Bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University (2012). His primary research interests are data structure lower bounds. He also works in algorithm design and communication complexity. http://theory.stanford.edu/~yuhch123/ "

"Wednesday, May 9, 2018",5:00 - 10:00 pm,4107 Thomas M. Siebel Center for Computer Science,Virtual Reality Open House,"Virtual and augmented reality technology has recently advanced by leaps and bounds due to widespread investment and interest from consumers, corporations, and campuses around the world. The VR course at the University of Illinois is a one-of-a-kind experience for students that empowers them by leveraging the latest tools and technology. In addition to learning fundamentals about human perception and VR engineering, they collaboratively build first-person, immersive experiences that have the power to touch people in a way that was not possible a decade ago, but is now easily accessible through smartphones and other consumer devices. Experience virtual reality for yourself through the eyes of Department of Computer Scienceâ€™s student VR projects from 5-10 p.m. on Wednesday, May 9, in the VR Lab at Siebel Center (room 4107) on the University of Illinois campus. Projects from Illinois Computer Science's Virtual Reality course include: Racing Sim: A collaboration with Illini Motorsports Formula SAE to allow student drivers to practice on actual race courses. The Heist: Work your way through blockchains to steal cryptocurrency. Space Meditation: Float through space to achieve a state of total relaxation. The Chicago Study: Explore how violent crime impacts public health through data gathered from a group of real women who live in Chicago. Physics VR Lab: Run physics simulations to learn about Newton's laws and make predictions about an experiment.
