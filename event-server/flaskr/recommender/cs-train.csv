"Wednesday, September 23, 2009",10:00 am,3401 Siebel Center,Timothy Bickmore of Northeastern University,"Title:  Personal Health Advocates Abstract:  Health behavior drives 70% of the cost in the US healthcare system and is responsible for 55% of deaths. Tobacco use results in $193B in healthcare costs and 443,000 deaths per year, and overweight and obesity result in another $100B in costs and 112,000 deaths per year. Health behavior continues to be a significant cost driver even after the healthcare system gets involved. Patients often do not show up for appointments or show up unprepared, and across most conditions and regimens, on average, only half of medications are taken as prescribed. In this talk I will describe a vision for an automated persistent, proactive and personified health advocate that functions as a self-care coach for preventive medicine and a mediator for interactions with the healthcare system. Ill present several systems that my lab has produced or have in development that work towards this vision, spanning wellness promotion to self-care education at hospital discharge to at-home medication adherence promotion. Ill discuss the dialogue systems and animated conversational agent technology underlying these systems, as well as applications in various stages of clinical trial, and experiences conducting R&D in the healthcare (and NIH) environment. The applications include exercise promotion for geriatrics patients (in clinical trial in the Geriatrics Clinic at Boston Medical Center), exercise promotion for Spanish-speaking older Latino adults (in clinical trial at Stanford Medical), antipsychotic medication adherence for adults with schizophrenia (completed trial with the University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing), and hospital bedside patient education (in clinical trial at Boston Medical Center).   Bio:  Timothy Bickmore is an Assistant Professor in the College of Computer and Information Science at Northeastern University. The focus of his research is on the development and evaluation of computer agents that emulate face-to-face interactions between health providers and patients for use in health education and long-term health behavior change interventions, with a particular focus on the emotional and relational aspects of these interactions. Prior to Northeastern, he spent two years as an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Boston University School of Medicine. Dr. Bickmore received his Ph.D. from MIT, doing his dissertation work in the Media Lab studying emotional interactions between people and animated computer characters."

"Monday, October 12, 2009",5:00 pm,2405 Siebel Center,Epic Technical Talk,"Abstract: The electronic health record (EHR) is a vital tool in the care and treatment of patients and a current political hot topic. In recent years, the EHR has grown from a place for basic documentation to a rich, interactive system that streamlines clinicians’ workflows and assists them with decisions on how best to care for their patients. The software developer who designs and programs today’s EHR is faced with a vast landscape of unique and complex development problems, and has the opportunity to positively impact the lives of millions of people.  This presentation will introduce the EHR and cover some of these challenges and problems. Discussed will be the challenges of sustaining rapid system performance as the number of end users in a system continues to grow, keeping costs down for managers of EHRs, maintaining accurate health information while patients receive care in various locations across the country, and using EHRs to assist clinicians in making safe and informed decisions.  Speaker Bios:  Paul Pawola is a software developer at Epic. He works with their clinical applications, and is currently working on their surgery documentation module. He graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2000 with a BS in Computer Engineering, and received his MS in Electrical Engineering in 2002.

In order to do this, concepts such as ""normal"", and ""the way things are"" had to be perceived as constructions rather than ""reality"" and ""necessity"". Could we again be in need of questioning the current ""reality""? Bio: Dr. Alan Kay is one of the pioneers of object-oriented programming, personal computing, and graphical user interfaces.

"Wednesday, September 29, 2010",5:00 - 6:00 pm,1404 Siebel Center,Big Data and the Future of Internet Scale Cloud Computing," Today, every click on Yahoo! relies on the company’s massive cloud computing infrastructure. Hundreds of Yahoo! Web sites visited by more than 600 million users worldwide each month produce massive pipelines of Big Data, with incredible business value. Processing and transforming that data is the key to creating increasingly relevant Internet experiences for people around the world. This talk will explore some of the emerging trends and challenges that the industry will face as cloud computing adoption continues on its sharp increase.     Looking to the future, Yahoo!’s vision for the cloud is closely intertwined with open source computing. Today, key components of Yahoo!’s cloud are available to the open source community, and in the future, more of that stack will be donated. Yahoo!’s cloud team in partnership with scientists from Yahoo! Labs, have deployed the world’s largest Hadoop implementations, to create a foundation for a more personally meaningful Web.         Raghu Ramakrishnan is Chief Scientist for Audience and Cloud Computing at Yahoo!, and is a Yahoo! Fellow, heading the Web Information Management research group. His work in database systems, with a focus on data mining, query optimization, and web-scale data management, has influenced query optimization in commercial database systems and the design of window functions in SQL:1999. His paper on the Birch clustering algorithm received the SIGMOD 10-Year Test-of-Time award, and he has written the widely-used text ""Database Management Systems"" (with Johannes Gehrke). Ramakrishnan has received several awards, including the ACM SIGKDD Innovations Award, the ACM SIGMOD Contributions Award, a Distinguished Alumnus Award from IIT Madras, a Packard Foundation Fellowship in Science and Engineering, and an NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award. He is a Fellow of the ACM and IEEE.       Ramakrishnan is on the Board of Directors of ACM SIGKDD, and is a past Chair of ACM SIGMOD and the Board of Trustees of the VLDB Endowment. He was Professor of Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and was founder and CTO of QUIQ, a company that pioneered question-answering communities, powering Ask Jeeves' AnswerPoint as well as customer-support for companies such as Compaq."

It has been around for many years. But what has given the concept a rebirth is the advancement of integrated circuit technology. We can now, with confidence, say that we will be able to put billions of transistors on one piece of silicon. We call it System on a Chip (SoC). But with that realization, we have discovered not all is goodness. This talk will look at multiprocessing, or multicore as some call it, and highlight both the goodness and the difficulties we face in this new world of options.

Many studies have shown that when users are ushered off the conventional search result pages, their needs are often only partially met. To tackle this challenge, we optimize Bing, Microsofts decision engine, to not just navigate users to a landing page through a blue link but to continue engaging with users to facilitate task completion. Underlying this new paradigm is the Bing Dialog Model that consists of three building blocks: an indexing system that systematically and comprehensively harvests task knowledge from the web, an intent model that statistically infers and matches users needs to the task knowledge, and an interaction model that elicits user intents through mathematically optimized presentations. In this talk, Ill describe Bing Dialog Model in details and demonstrate it in action through the innovative features recently introduced in Bing. About Harry ShumHarry Shum is the corporate vice president responsible for search product development at Microsoft Corp. Previously he oversaw the research activities at Microsoft Research Asia and the lab's collaborations with universities in the Asia Pacific region, and was responsible for the Internet Services Research Center, an applied research organization dedicated to long-term and short-term technology investments in search and advertising at Microsoft. Shum joined Microsoft Research in 1996, as a researcher based in Redmond, Wash. He moved to Beijing as one of the founding members of Microsoft Research China (later renamed Microsoft Research Asia). There he began a nine-year tenure as a research manager, subsequently moving on to become assistant managing director, managing director of Microsoft Research Asia, Distinguished Engineer and corporate vice president. Shum is an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Fellow and an Association for Computing Machinery Fellow for his contributions on computer vision and computer graphics.

"Tuesday, February 15, 2011",7:00 pm,CSL 238 (Videoconferencing Room),Error Esitmating Coding,"   ""Error Estimating Coding""  Chen BinBin Research Fellow in the School of Computing, National University of Singapore Candidate for Position with Advanced Digital Sciences Center  http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~chenbinb  Date/ Time/ Location: February, 15, 2011, 7pm, CSL 238 (Videoconferencing Room) Abstract:  One key and long-standing challenge in wireless networks is to deal with bit errors that occur during transmission. Error correcting codes and error detecting codes have long been playing fundamental roles to deal with bit errors. The shared philosophy behind these codes is that we should ensure a packet is fully correct before further using it. Motivated by recent emerging wireless designs that can leverage partially correct packets, this talk will introduce a new class of coding design, namely Error Estimating Coding (EEC). Without correcting the errors in a received packet, EEC enables the receiver to estimate the number of errors in the packet. Compared to error correcting codes, the advantages of EEC lie in its significantly reduced redundancy and computational overhead for achieving its weaker but conveniently useful functionality. Thus, EEC provides wireless network designers a new tradeoff point on the spectrum between overhead and functionality, which was not previously available. In this talk, I will discuss how the meta-information provided by EEC can benefit a wide range of wireless network applications. To demonstrate the utility of EEC in the real world, the talk will summarize our experimental results with two wireless network applications that we have implemented. I will also present the design of our EEC algorithm that provides provable estimation quality with rather low redundancy and computational overhead.

"Tuesday, February 22, 2011",7:00 pm,CSL 238 (Videoconferencing Room),Ensuring Safety & Sustainability in Cyber-Physical Systems,"Abstract:  Recent technological advances and smaller form factors in embedded computing and wireless sensing devices have enabled coordination, monitoring, automated control, and facilitation of various physical processes in a diverse set of applications, e.g., automated vehicles and automated healthcare. Such systems with strong coupling with the physical environment are referred as the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), and the interactions between these systems and the physical environment are referred as Cyber-Physical Interactions (CPIs). A major challenge in this regard is to ensure: (i) safety, i.e. ensuring the impact of computing operations (e.g., operations in medical device control systems such as insulin pumps) on physical processes (e.g., human physiological processes such as variation of blood glucose level) are within desirable limits; and (ii) sustainability, i.e. ensuring uninterrupted safe operation with minimum available resources (e.g., uninterrupted operation of medical devices from energy available from the battery or on-body scavenging sources).    This talk would focus on model-driven design, verification, and management of safe and sustainable CPSs. This involves: (a) characterization of CPIs in order to be able to properly model and evaluate CPSs’ safety and sustainability; and (b) application of the model-driven verification and management to smart-healthcare domain. Further, the model-driven management can reap significant benefits in green and sustainable computing in existing computing infrastructure, e.g. data centers (that are the principal infrastructure for modern computing clouds). Modeling of a data center from a cyber-physical perspective can aid in awareness of the computing servers’ impact on temperature distribution and cooling demand (a form of CPI) in the data center. The cooling energy required to maintain a safe operating temperature in data centers can be reduced if this awareness is integrated in data center resource management decision making. Moreover, to ensure general applicability of the model-driven management, the CPI characterization needs to be performed for a diverse spectrum of domains, e.g., power-grid and autonomous vehicle, which is an important future research direction.

"Thursday, April 07, 2011",10:00 am,2405 Siebel Center,Special Distinguished Seminar: Linda Petzold,"Spatial Stochastic Simulation of Polarization in Yeast Mating In microscopic systems formed by living cells, the small numbers of some reactant molecules can result in dynamical behavior that is discrete and stochastic rather than continuous and deterministic. Spatio-temporal gradients and patterns play an important role in many of these systems. In this lecture we report on recent progress in the development of computational methods and software for spatial stochastic simulation. Then we describe a spatial stochastic model ofpolarisome formation in mating yeast. The new model is built on simple mechanistic components, but is able to achieve a highly polarized phenotype with a relatively shallow input gradient, and to track movement in the gradient. The spatial stochastic simulations are able to reproduce experimental observations to an extent that is not possible with deterministic simulation.

"Friday, July 08, 2011",11:00 am,3405 Siebel Center,Verified Software Toolchain,"The software toolchain includes static analyzers to check assertions about programs; optimizing compilers to translate programs to machine language; operating systems and libraries to supply context for programs. Our Verified Software Toolchain verifies with machine-checked proofs that the assertions claimed at the top of the toolchain really hold in the machine-language program, running in the operating-system context, on a weakly-consistent-shared-memory machine. Our verification approach is modular, in that proofs about operating systems or concurrency libraries are oblivious of the programming language or machine language, proofs about compilers are oblivious of the program logic used to verify static analyzers, and so on. The approach is scalable, in that each component is verified in the semantic idiom most natural for that component. Finally, the verification is foundational: the trusted base for proofs of observable properties of the machine-language program includes only the operational semantics of the machine language, not the source language, the compiler, the program logic, or any other part of the toolchaineven when these proofs are carried out by source-level static analyzers.

"Monday, September 19, 2011",4:00 pm,2405 Siebel Center,Communicating Computers vs. Computing Communiators: Crying Out For a New Theory,"Abstract: The theories of computing (Turing, ~1930s) and communication (Shannon, Hamming ~1940s) have had a profound impact of the development of the two fields and the resulting technologies have drastically altered our lives today. Part of the success of the two theories can be attributed to a clean separation of the computing elements from the communicating elements. Today, however, communication and computing are coming ever closer together, often leaving the human out of the loop. This merger is posing new challenges, definitional and algorithmic, to the theory of communication. In this talk I will describe some of the concrete challenges that we have looked at. I will also describe our attempts at modeling these problems and, in some cases, describe some preliminary solutions.

"Monday, October 10, 2011",4:00 pm,2405 Siebel Center,The Application Memory Wall Thoughts on the State of the Art in Garbage Collection,"Abstract:The original ""memory wall"" first predicted in the mid 1990's was supposed to have been hit by now, with applications stretching server capabilities to their limits. However, today's typical application instance only utilizes 5-10% of a modern server's capacity, and the percentage is dropping.In this session, I will discusses the ""Application Memory Wall"" and and the likely causes of an observed decade-long stagnation in application instance memory growth and consumption. I will analyze the key technical challenges that have led to the emergence of the Application Memory Wall, reviewing the relevant state of the art in garbage collection within managed runtimes in general, and in commercial Java Virtual Machines in particular.I will outline the main technical problem areas that need industry and academic attention and focus. I will then dive into the details of an actual collector (Azul's C4 garbage collector, http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1993491) that addresses the identified set of problems, and show how such solutions can lead to a post-Wall era - an era in which applications will once again be free to productively and naturally consume the abundant compute resources available in modern servers. Bio:Gil Tene is CTO and co-founder of Azul Systems. He has been involved with virtual machine technologies for the past 20 years and has been building Java technology-based products since 1995. Gil pioneered Azul's Continuously Concurrent Compacting Collector (C4), Java Virtualization, Elastic Memory, and various managed runtime and systems stack technologies that combine to deliver the industry's most scalable and robust Java platforms. ""In 2006 he was named one of the Top 50 Agenda Setters in the technology industry by Silicon.com. Prior to co-founding Azul, Gil held key technology positions at Nortel Networks, Shasta Networks and at Check Point Software Technologies, where he delivered several industry-leading traffic management solutions including the industry's first Firewall-1 based security appliance.

"Monday, October 24, 2011",4:00 pm,2405 Siebel Center,Defending Against Client Compromises in Client-Server Applications,"Abstract: We present new methods for defending against client compromises in two client-server application scenarios. First, we consider online games, in which a client ""compromise"" reflects the unauthorized manipulation of the game client by the user himself, in order to cheat in the game. To address this threat, we develop a new cheat-detection method with which the server can validate that the messages received from the game client are consistent with the sanctioned client software. Second, we consider a user entering private information to a trusted web server, via a client computer that might be compromised by malware. To address this threat, we leverage trusted computing technology in a novel way to ferry the user's private inputs to the remote server while ensuring that malware cannot capture it. This latter technology has usability implications, and we report the results of a three-month user study to evaluate these implications. Bio:Michael Reiter is the Lawrence M.

"Thursday, October 27, 2011",1:00 pm,2405 Siebel Center,Content Optimization and Recommendation at Yahoo!,"Abstract:Recommending engaging content to users is important for the success of a digital media company like Yahoo!. Traditionally, content has been primarily programmed by humans. Algorithmically optimizing content is an attractive strategy; however, it presents several interesting challenges. For example, the content pool can be dynamic: the pool is ever-changing, the popularity of each item varies over time, and items have short lifetimes. A good system needs to react quickly to deliver personally relevant content to millions of users with widely varying tastes. And often, there are multiple objectives that need to be optimized. In this talk, Pradeep will present an overview of key techniques that address some of the challenges in web content optimization. Specifically, he will start with explore-exploit methods that can efficiently identify popular items from a dynamic content pool. Next, he will describe a probabilistic matrix factorization framework that combines feature-based regression and matrix factorization to predict user's preferences of items effectively in both ""cold-start"" and ""warm-start"" situations. Finally, he will speak about how one can optimize for the different objectives that arise in such settings, and conclude with a few key scientific challenges. Bio:Pradheep Elango is an applied researcher at Yahoo! Labs interested in web data mining problems. He leads the recommendation science team in Yahoo! Labs, a team of applied scientists and engineers focused on statistical models and machine learning techniques for recommending personalized content on Yahoo! Pradheep and his collaborators have deployed algorithms that significantly improved engagement on various Yahoo! portals, including the Yahoo Frontpage. He has also co-authored publications in this area, one of which was awarded the best paper at ICDM."

"Monday, October 31, 2011",4:00 pm,2405 Siebel Center,DLS Talk: UNVALLEYING THE UNCANNY,"Abstract:In terms of aesthetics, CG character animation has become a victim of its own success. Twenty years ago, recreating human beings in virtual 3D space was a fantasy, a ""Holy Grail"" of computer animation. Today, that fantasy is a reality that surrounds us in films, games, and even TV commercials.  The modeling, animation and rendering of characters as photorealistic human substitutes has become almost commonplace in popular culture. But, an unintended side effect of this success is that audiences are largely alienated from, not attracted to, these characters. This seeming paradox is often called the ""Uncanny Valley"".  The Uncanny Valley is a consequence of a very basic but incredibly refined human acuity--perceiving honesty, or the lack of it, when we observe people. The photorealistic characters in many contemporary CG-animated films are not honest. They pretend to be real humans, but we can feel that they're not: their eyes don't move properly, their movements are slightly too fluid. We instinctively realize weíre being hoodwinked, and we stop trusting. In Chris' films Bingo, Ryan and The Spine, he's dangled his feet over the Uncanny Valley and sometimes fallen into it. From his experience in creating these films, he will be sharing my observations about realism, believability, empathy and trust in CG character animation. Bio:Chris received an MS in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from the University of Illinois in 1986; but before long, the siren call of Art beckoned. So in 1989, Chris studied Computer Animation under Prof. Donna Cox, at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). This period of time doomed Chris to a lifetime obsession with this field. In 1994, Chris joined Alias Inc. (now Autodesk Inc.), as an in-house artist.  Chris's filmmaking work during this time was one of the driving forces in developing the animation platform Maya. Chris animated two short films, the end in 1995, and Bingo in 1998. the end earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Short Film, in 1996.  Bingo received the Canadian Genie Award in 1999.In 2004, Chris released Ryan, a short animated documentary. Ryan tells the story of his friend, Ryan Larkin, by using a strange combination of CG photorealism and metaphorical psychic flourishes (Chris calls this approach “Psychorealism”). Ryan received the 2005 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, and over 60 other international awards. In 2009, Chris released The Spine, an unsettling exploration of a troubled marriage of two people in their mid-50's, and choices which are both tragic and redemptive. One of Chris's primary passions is the study of the human face, and how it can be animated. He is an expert in facial anatomy and Paul Ekman's Facial Action Coding System, used by animation studios worldwide. He has taught programs in Facial Animation at Seneca College, the University of Toronto, TRUEMAX Academy in Denmark, and Dreamworks Animation in California.In April 2011, Chris received a Guggenheim Fellowship for his animated filmmaking, and for development of his upcoming short film, Subconscious Password."

"Monday, January 23, 2012",12:00 pm,3401 Siebel Center,Health Informatics of Measuring Data for Population Health: Health Determinants and New Technologies,"Bio:Bruce Schatz is Head of Medical Information Science, College of Medicine, and Professor, Department of Computer Science Abstract:Healthcare is the economic crisis of our time, there is no viable infrastructure for health systems. At the core is a fundamental lack of actionable data, it is not possible today to accurately predict which persons have which outcomes. A new health system with better health management will require better health measurement, which will enable higher quality at lower cost. It is feasible to use new technologies to provide rich datasets necessary for adequate measurement, which can enable predictive modeling for improving practical healthcare by clustering persons into population cohorts for effective management. This talk is based upon the recent book by the speaker on Healthcare Infrastructure: Health Systems for Individuals and Populations, which is also the basis of his course CS416 Health Informatics. This book can be read for free with UIUC login at http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-0-85729-452-4 . A variant was given at the recent NSF Workshop on Measuring Data for Population Health, which he organized to plan future initiatives for the NSF SmartHealth and the NIH mHealth programs. The talk focuses upon Health Determinants, which problems of medicine should be measured with which features, and New Technologies, which solutions of engineering should be developed and deployed to measure and manage these features. Particular emphasis is placed upon scalable technologies from internet services, using mobile devices to measure everyday life. Examples are given from research prototypes, with research directions for informatics students."
"Monday, January 23, 2012",4:00 pm,2405 SC,3D Integrated Circuits'Their Impact on the Design of Computers,"Trevor Mudge, Bredt Family Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor Abstract:Integrated circuits have employed only 2-dimensions, in the past. Recently this has begun to change and some chip manufactures are starting to take advantage of the third dimension. This talk will discuss why this change is occurring and the opportunities that it opens up to computer system designers. The chips in cell phones, laptops, and the data centers behind the 'cloud' are essentially 2-dimensional. The logic circuits and the wires that interconnect them are laid on the surface of a small die of silicon that is from 1 to 2 cm square. The 2-dimensional nature of chips has been the case since integrated circuits were invented by Robert Noyce and Jack Kilby in the late 1950s . Until recently the restriction to 2-dimensions has not been a limitation because the trend characterized by Moore's Law has meant that chip density doubles every two years'there seemed little reason to venture into the third dimension with its potential for additional cost. In recent years three things have changed: 1) Moore's Law has started to run into difficulties; 2) power consumption in integrated circuits has become a limitation; and 3) the space taken by the chips themselves has become critical. These points will be discussed in more detail in the talk. Bio:Trevor Mudge received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois. He is now at The University of Michigan. He was named the Bredt Professor of Engineering after a ten-year term as Director of the Advanced Computer Architecture Laboratory'a group of a dozen faculty and sixty graduate students. He is the author of numerous papers on computer architecture, programming languages, VLSI design, and computer vision. He has also supervised about fifty theses in these areas.

Fredkin University Professor and founding head of the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University. His research interests lie in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cognitive neuroscience. Mitchell is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering, a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and a Fellow and Past President of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). Mitchell believes the field of machine learning will be the fastest growing branch of computer science during the 21st century. His web page is http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom. Abstract: We describe our efforts to build a Never-Ending Language Learner (NELL) that runs 24 hours per day, forever, learning to read the web. Each day NELL extracts (reads) more facts from the web, and integrates these into its growing knowledge base of beliefs. Each day NELL also learns to read better than yesterday, enabling it to go back to the text it read yesterday, and extract more facts, more accurately. NELL has been running 24 hours/day for over two years. The result so far is a collection of 15 million interconnected beliefs (e.g., servedWtih(coffee, applePie), isA(applePie, bakedGood) ), that NELL is considering at different levels of confidence, along with hundreds of thousands of learned phrasings, morphoogical features, and web page structures that NELL uses to extract beliefs from the web. The approach implemented by NELL is based on three key ideas: (1) coupling the semi-supervised training of thousands of different functions that extract different types of information from different web sources, (2) automatically discovering new constraints that more tightly couple the training of these functions over time, and (3) a curriculum or sequence of increasing difficult learning tasks.

"Thursday, March 08, 2012",12:30 pm,4405 SC,Franz Franchetti: SPIRAL: Automating High Quality Software Production,"Abstract:The SPIRAL system (www.spiral.net, www.spiralgen.com) is a software production system that automatically generates highly efficient software for important kernel functionality on modern processor architectures. It targets machines across the spectrum from embedded and mobile devices through desktop and server-class machines up to supercomputers. For signal and image processing and communication functions such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT), convolution/correlation, or a Viterbi decoder, SPIRAL has proven to automatically generate code that is tuned to the given processor and computing platform, and is outperforming expertly hand-tuned implementations. Performance metrics include computational efficiency and execution rate, energy efficiency, code size, or a composite of the above.In this talk, we give a short overview on the core SPIRAL technology. We then explain how Spiral generates efficient programs for embedded and mobile platforms, targets multicore processors, ISA extensions like AVX and SSE, supercomputer-class systems, field programmable gate arrays, and graphics processors (GPUs). We will highlight extensions of Spiral that target Larrabee/MIC, discuss how we provide industry-strength code used in Intel's IPP and MKL, and provide an early look at work on optical flow done with Intel ECG.

Ricketts: RF Devices, Circuits & Systems, from Nanometers to Kilometers","Abstract:  In this talk I will discuss three research projects that leverage several areas of circuits, systems and device physics to solve new problems in radio frequency applications. The first part of my talk begins in circuits with the millimeter scale and discusses our research aimed at significantly increase the speed, power output and efficiency of mm-wave power amplifiers (PA). Current state-of-the-art Si PAs above 20 GHz suffer from low power-added-efficiency (PAE) and output power, typically < 20% and < 0.5W. I will present our recent results in the development of high PAE (20% - 50%) PAs above 45 GHz using SiGe and 45 nm CMOS and also our work on the development of novel power combiners. The second part of my talk will present a non-line-of-sight position location system using low frequency magnetoquasistatic fields (l~1 km). Our initial application is in tracking an American football during a game, which is extremely difficult due to the constant obstruction of the ball by the players. We circumvent this problem by using magnetoquasistatic fields, which are not perturbed by the presence of human bodies, to develop a novel tracking system. I will present our recent research results in collaboration with Disney/ESPN that show the ability to track a football across a football field with approximately 1 ft average error. In the final part of my talk I will discuss our work using nanoscale spin-torque oscillators for RF signal generation. Bio: David S.

"Thursday, April 12, 2012",12:30 pm,2102 SC,"ISTC-EC: Geometry of Diversity and Determinantal Point Processes: Representation, Inference and Learning","Abstract: Graphical models are the dominant tool for capturing complex joint distributions in computer vision and natural language processing prediction tasks. However, inference and learning for all but a small, restrictive subset of graphical models is intractable, and standard approximation methods often fail for distributions with global, negative correlations. Determinantal point processes (DPPs) provide a computationally tractable alternative. DPPs arise in random matrix theory and quantum physics as models of random variables with negative correlations. Among their many remarkable properties, they offer tractable algorithms for exact inference, including computing marginals, computing certain conditional probabilities, and sampling. DPPs are a natural model for subset selection problems where diversity is preferred. For example, they can be used to selectdiverse sets of sentences to form document summaries, or to return relevant but varied text and image search results, or to detect non-overlapping multiple object trajectories in video.  I'll present our recent work on a novel factorization and dual representation of DPPs that enables efficient inference for exponentially-sizedstructured sets. We develop a new inference algorithm based on Newton identities for DPPs conditioned on subset size. We also derive efficient parameter estimation for DPPs from several types of observations. I'll show the advantages of the model on several natural language and vision tasks: extractive document summarization, diversifying image search results and multi-person articulated pose estimation problems in images.

"Thursday, May 24, 2012",12:30 pm,2102 SC  Live Webinar,ISTC-EC SEMINAR SERIES (Intel Science and Technology Center in Embedded Computing),"“Dynamic Scene Understanding for Driver Assistance” Prof. James M. Rehg, Georgia Institute of Technology Abstract:In this talk I will review our current progress in developing methods for dynamic scene understanding that can support new forms of driver assistance. Our approach is based purely on visual information collected from one or more vehicle-mounted cameras. I will begin by reviewing the challenges that arise in geometric reconstruction of the vehicle environment when the scene consists not only of static objects (buildings, bridges, etc.) but also contains independently moving objects such as cars or people. I will present an approach to simultaneously recovering the scene geometry and vehicle motion which can address the presence of additional independently moving objects. While geometric models of the scene are useful for route-planning and driver safety, additional semantic information about the scene is needed to support driver assistance. Examples of semantic information include the name and function of nearby buildings, the identification of navigation landmarks, the detection of entrances and exits, and so forth. I will describe an approach to combining pixel-level semantic labels with 3D geometry to support reasoning about the semantics and structure of the vehicle environment. I will show preliminary results on some standard datasets. In order for video analysis processes to co-exist within a heterogenous task environment and meet the constraints of a real-time embedded platform, it is desirable to have flexible, resource-aware analysis techniques which can adapt to the available system resources on-the-fly. We are developing a principled approach to the construction of resource-aware vision algorithms. I will present preliminary results from an incremental approach to feature learning.

"Thursday, May 31, 2012",12:30 pm,"Room 4403, Siebel Center, 4th Floor",Stochastic Computing for Embedded Applications,"  AbstractThis talk proposes statistical information processing to address the challenges associated in the design of robust and energy-efficient SOCs for embedded applications. Statistical information processing is a communications-inspired design paradigm for nanoscale embedded SOCs. It treats the problem of information processing in nanoscale silicon as a problem of information transfer over a noisy channel. Thus, it is able to exploit the principles of reliable information transfer developed by communication system designers and information theorists over the past six decades to achieve both energy-efficiency and reliability in nanoscale embedded systems. The notions of stochastic computing and system-assisted mixed-signal design emerge when the communications-inspired view is applied to computing and mixed-signal design, respectively. Key elements of this paradigm are the use of statistical signal processing principles, equalization and error-control, for designing error-resilient on-chip computation, communication, storage, and mixed-signal analog front-ends. This talk will describe the principles of statistical information processing, including measured results from silicon implementations, that demonstrate the promise of this design paradigm. The talk will conclude with a discussion of the potential benefits of applying statistical information processing techniques, primarily stochastic computing, to the design of robust and energy-efficient machine learning kernels.

"Thursday, June 14, 2012",12:30 pm,Location: 4403 SC,"Improving Bag of Words:  Doublets, Triplets and Beyond"," Abstract: The “bag of words” (BoW) method, although popular in image analysis, is known to have limits because it does not consider any geometry information. High-order features have been proposed to incorporate geometrical information into the BoW representation. However, due to computation complexity, prior work considered only up to third order features. We propose a framework in which we can identify all high-order features in time linear to the number of features in an image, regardless of the order. In large-scale image matching applications, matching features between the query and candidate images can be very challenging computationally. In our experiments based on the 1M dataset, we show that, based on the proposed framework, we can use high-order features to achieve better retrieval accuracy at manageable computational cost. This approach has application in image retrieval, object detection and recognition, and 3D reconstruction.

"Wednesday, November 07, 2012",12:00 pm,2240 DCL,CSE Seminar: Construction of Non-equilibrium Hydrodynamic Models for Atmospheric Entry Plasmas,"Construction of Non-equilibrium Hyrdodynamic Models for Atmospheric Entry Plasmas Pizza Provided!    Prof. Marco Panesi, Aerospace Engineering, UIUCHigh-speed atmospheric entry simulations are complex problems due to their multi-physics and multi-scale nature. Progress in the ability to accurately model these systems has been hindered by the lack of reliable physical and chemical models for collisional and radiative processes. Furthermore, the predictive capabilities of these models are often established by a simple comparison of the model predictions against results from legacy experimental measurements, the accuracy of which is often not well characterized. Substantial progress in the area of computational chemistry, along with increased computational resources, have allowed for the construction of realistic models based on molecular-scale dynamics. I propose to use state-specific collisional radiative models as a powerful tool to derive macroscopic conservation equations, energy exchange terms and chemical production rates for atmospheric entry plasmas. I will cover the key aspects involved in model development, namely: (1) using ab-initio quantum calculations as a powerful tool to construct high- fidelity physics-based models; (2) defining reduced-order models for the simulation of 2D and 3D flows (e.g., coarse-grain modeling); (3) validating physical models and determining the uncertainty in their predictive capabilities, based on the most recent developments in Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) algorithms (e.g., Bayesian inference).

He received his PhD from Princeton University in 2012, advised by David Blei. His research lies in probabilistic graphical models and their applications to real-world problems. He has won several awards, including a best student paper award at KDD 2011, a notable paper award at AISTATS 2011 and a best student paper award honorable mention at NIPS 2009. He received the Google PhD Fellowship for machine learning and the Siebel Scholar Fellowship. His thesis was nominated for ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award by Princeton University in 2012. Abstract: We live in the era of ""Big Data,"" where we are surrounded by a dauntingly vast amount of information. How can we help people quickly navigate the data and acquire useful knowledge from it? Probabilistic models provide a general framework for analyzing, predicting and understanding the underlying patterns in the large-scale and complex data. In this talk, I will show how we can build a new document recommender system using probabilistic modeling. First, I will describe a new model for document recommendation (i.e., suggesting documents to read). This model not only gives better recommendation performance, but also provides a new user experience through exploratory analysis. For example, a user can adjust her preferences and the system can adaptively change the recommendations. Second, building a recommender system like this requires learning the probabilistic model from large-scale empirical data. I will describe a scalable approach for learning a wide class of probabilistic models, a class that includes our recommendation model, from massive data.  "

There, he worked on a variety of topics all aiming to broaden the utility of high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods. In support of his research, Dr. Kloeckner has publicly released numerous scientific software packages. Among his most widely-used packages are the PyCUDA and PyOpenCL toolkits. These packages ease the use of heterogeneous compute devices, including GPUs. In the fall of 2010, Klöckner has joined the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University as a Courant Instructor. There, he is working on problems in high-order integral equation methods for electromagnetic scattering with Leslie Greengard, in addition to teaching graduate-level high-performance computing. Abstract: The changing computing landscape surrounding numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) provides motivation for a reconsideration of the benefits of various types of numerical schemes. As an example, high-order methods and methods based on integral equations, previously viewed as costly, are seeing much renewed interest. Integral equation methods for the solution of partial differential equations, when coupled with suitable fast algorithms, yield geometrically flexible, asymptotically optimal and well-conditioned schemes. The practical application of these methods, however, requires the accurate evaluation of boundary integrals with singular, weakly singular or nearly singular kernels. We will examine a new systematic, high-order approach that works for any singularity. The scheme, denoted QBX (quadrature by expansion), is easy to implement and compatible with fast hierarchical algorithms such as the fast multipole method. We will see how the analysis-based mathematical properties of QBX position it ideally to tackle very general engineering problems while making good use of today's high-performance computational resources.

"Wednesday, February 20, 2013",11:00 am,2405 Siebel Center,"Dr. Danny Dig, ""Interactive Program Transformations""","Bio: Danny Dig is a Visiting Research Assistant Professor at Illinois. He got a PhD from Illinois where his research won the best PhD dissertation award, and the First Prize at the ACM Student Research Competition Grand Finals. He did a postdoc at MIT where he opened the area of interactive transformations for parallelism, then he returned to Illinois. He (co-)authored 35+ journal and conference papers that appeared in top places in SE/PL. According to Google Scholar his publications have been cited 1,000+ times. He released 8 software systems, among them the world's first open-source refactoring tool, downloaded over 17,000 times. Some of the techniques he developed are shipping with the official release of the popular Eclipse and NetBeans development environments, and are used by millions of Java programmers everyday. He has started two popular workshops: Workshop on Refactoring Tools, and Hot Topics On Software Upgrades. Both are now in their fifth year. He chaired or co-organized 11 workshops, and served as a member of 28 program or review committees for all top conferences in his area. His research is funded by NSF, Boeing, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft.   Abstract: Change is the heart of software development. For example, software evolves to add features, fix bugs, support new hardware, new versions of operating systems and libraries, and new user interfaces. Unfortunately, programmers perform most software changes manually, through low-level text edits, which are almost never reused. This makes software development time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive. It is widely known that at least two-thirds of software costs are due to evolution, with some industrial surveys claiming 90%. In this talk Dr. Dig will present our ever-growing toolset of interactive program transformations. It currently automates changes from the domains of parallelism, software upgrades, testing, and end-user programming. He will highlight transformations from two domains: converting a mutable into an immutable class, and improving the maintainability and performance of spreadsheets. Our transformations do not require any program annotations, yet the transformations span multiple, non-adjacent, program statements. A find-and-replace tool can not perform such transformations, which require control- and data-flow analysis. Empirical evaluation shows that our toolset is useful: (i) it dramatically reduces the burden of analyzing and changing code, (ii) it is fast so it can be used interactively, (iii) it correctly applies transformations that open-source developers applied incompletely, and (iv) users prefer the improved quality of the changed code."
"Monday, February 25, 2013",11:00 am,2405 Siebel Center,Dr. Tao Xie: Improving Software Dependability via Cooperative Testing and Analysis,"Bio: Tao Xie is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at North Carolina State University. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Washington in 2005, advised by David Notkin. He has worked as a visiting researcher at Microsoft Research Redmond and Microsoft Research Asia. His research interests are in software engineering, focusing on software testing, program analysis, and software analytics. He has served as the ACM SIGSOFT History Liaison in the SIGSOFT Executive Committee as well as a member of the ACM History Committee (ACM History SGB Liaison). He is an ACM Distinguished Speaker and an IEEE Computer Society Distinguished Visitor. He received an NSF CAREER Award in 2009. He received a 2011 Microsoft Research Software Engineering Innovation Foundation (SEIF) Award, 2008, 2009, and 2010 IBM Faculty Awards, and a 2008 IBM Jazz Innovation Award. He received the ASE 2009 Best Paper Award and an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award. His homepage is at http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/xie/. Abstract: Tool automation to reduce manual effort has been an active research area in various subfields of software engineering such as software testing, analysis, and analytics for improving software dependability. To maximize the value of software testing, analysis, and analytics, effective support for cooperation between engineers and tools is greatly needed and yet lacking in state-of-the-art research and practice. In particular, software testing, analysis, and analytics are in a great need of (1) effective ways for engineers to communicate their goals and guidance to tools and (2) tools with strong enough capabilities to accomplish the given goals and with effective ways to communicate challenges faced by them to engineers -- enabling a feedback loop between engineers and tools to refine and accomplish the goals. In addition, there is a great need of allowing different engineers or users to cooperate to assist software testing, analysis, and analytics (similar to the form of crowdsourcing), and allowing different tools to cooperate to address their respective weaknesses. A new research frontier on synergistic cooperation between human and tools, tools and tools, and human and human is yet to be explored. This talk presents our recent advances and future directions towards cooperative testing and analysis for improving software dependability."

Her work has received best paper awards or nominations at both of the premiere HCI conferences (CHI and UIST), and been recognized by the machine learning community through invited papers at IJCAI and ICML. She is the recipient of the 2011 Google PhD Fellowship in Design Development, and holds a BS in Computer Science from Stanford. Abstract: The Web has transformed the nature of creative work. For the ﬁrst time, millions of people have a direct outlet for sharing their creations with the world. As a result, the Web has become the largest repository of design knowledge in human history, and the ensuing “democratization of design” has created a critical feedback loop, engendering a new culture of reuse and remixing. The means and methods designers employ to draw on prior work, however, remain mostly informal and ad hoc. How can content producers find relevant examples amongst hundreds of millions of possibilities and leverage existing design practice to inform and improve their creations? My research explores data-driven techniques for working with examples at scale during the design process, automating search and curation, enabling rapid retargeting, and learning generative probabilistic models to support new design interactions.

He obtained the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from University of Minnesota and the B.S. degree in mathematics from Zhejiang University. He was a winner of the SIAM Student Paper Prize and a recipient of the University of Minnesota doctoral dissertation fellowship. His research interest is numerical linear algebra and its applications in a broad sense, including data mining, machine learning, graph algorithms, parallel processing and scientific computing. Currently he is developing large-scale computational and parallel techniques for statistical analysis of big data.   Abstract: As the term ``big data'' appears more and more frequently in our daily life and research activities, it changes our knowledge of how large the scale of the data can be and challenges the application of numerical analysis for performing statistical calculations. In this talk, I will focus on two basic statistics problems---sampling a multivariate normal distribution and maximum likelihood estimation---and illustrate the scalability issue that dense numerical linear algebra techniques are facing. The large-scale challenge motivates us to develop scalable methods for dense matrices commonly seen in statistical analysis. I will present several recent developments on the computations of matrix functions and on the solution of a linear system of equations, where the matrices therein are large-scale, fully dense, but structured. The driving ideas of these developments are the exploration of the structures and the use of fast matrix-vector multiplications to reduce the general quadratic cost in storage and cubic cost in computation. ``Big data'' offers a fresh opportunity for numerical analysts to develop algorithms with a central goal of scalability in mind. It also brings in a new stream of requests to high performance computing for highly parallel codes accompanied with the development of numerical algorithms. Scalable and parallelizable methods are key for convincing statisticians and practitioners to apply the powerful statistical theories on large-scale data that they currently feel uncomfortable to handle."

He received his Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from M.I.T. and followed with post-doctoral research in the Dept. of Applied Mathematics at Caltech, where he was the first recipient of prize fellowship in the Center for Research in Parallel Computing. Fischer was on the faculty in the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown prior to joining Argonne. He is a recipient of the Gordon Bell Prize for high-performance computing. Fischer's work is primarily in the areas of scalable parallel algorithms, spectral element methods, and iterative solvers, with a particular focus on computational fluid dynamics and the simulation of complex turbulent flows. His open source spectral element code, Nek5000, is currently used by over150 researchers worldwide and has scaled to over a million processes. Abstract: We explore fundamental complexity considerations that will drive algorithmic design choices for computational fluid dynamics, and PDE-based simulation in general, as we move beyond petascale computing. We argue that high-order methods using implicit or semi-implicit solvers are essential to efficient simulation for a variety of multiscale problems. These methods can be realized at per-point-costs equivalent to low-order methods. We further show that multilevel solvers having bounded iteration counts can scale to billion-way concurrency. We analyze the scalability of (low- or high-order) domain decomposition approaches to predict parallel performance on exascale architectures. These predictions shed light on what exascale computation might enable and provide insight to design requirements for exascale algorithms, codes, and architectures to have the broadest possible impact."

For instance, one may be interested in understanding the stratification of a population into subgroups, the thematic make-up of a collection of documents, or the dynamical process governing a complex time series. Many of the core statistical estimation problems for these applications are, in general, provably intractable for both computational and statistical reasons; and therefore progress is made by shifting the focus to realistic instances that rule out the intractable cases. In this talk, I'll describe a general computational approach for correctly estimating a wide class of statistical models, including Gaussian mixture models, Hidden Markov models, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Probabilistic Context Free Grammars, and several more. The key idea is to exploit the structure of low-order correlations that is present in high-dimensional data. The scope of the new approach extends beyond the purview of previous algorithms; and it leads to both new theoretical guarantees for unsupervised machine learning, as well as fast and practical algorithms for large-scale data analysis."
"Thursday, March 14, 2013",10:00 am,2405 Siebel Center,"Matei Zaharia, ""Making Big Data Analytics Interactive and Real-Time""","Bio: Matei Zaharia is a PhD student at UC Berkeley, working with Scott Shenker and Ion Stoica on topics in systems, cloud computing and networking. He is also a committer on Apache Mesos and Apache Hadoop. His work is supported by Google PhD fellowship. Matei got his undergraduate degree at the University of Waterloo in Canada.  Abstract: The rapid growth in data volumes requires new computer systems that scale out across hundreds of machines. While early frameworks, such as MapReduce, handled large-scale batch processing, the demands on these systems have also grown. Users quickly needed to run (1) more interactive ad-hoc queries, (2) more complex multi-pass algorithms (e.g. machine learning and graph processing), and (3) real-time processing on large data streams. In this talk, we present a single abstraction, resilient distributed datasets (RDDs), that supports all of these emerging workloads by providing efficient and fault-tolerant in-memory data sharing. We have used RDDs to build a stack of computing systems including the Spark parallel engine, Shark SQL processor, and Spark Streaming engine. Spark and Shark can run machine learning algorithms and interactive queries up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce, while Spark Streaming enables fault-tolerant stream processing at significantly higher scales than were possible before. These systems, along with several resource allocation and scheduling algorithms we have developed along the way, have been used in multiple industry and research applications, and have a growing open source community with 14 companies contributing in the past year."
"Wednesday, March 27, 2013",11:00 am,2405 Siebel Center,"Aditya Parameswaran: ""Human-Powered Data Management""","Bio: Aditya Parameswaran is a Ph.D. student in the InfoLab at Stanford University, advised by Prof. Hector Garcia-Molina. He is broadly interested in data management, with research results in human computation, information extraction, and recommendation systems. Aditya is a recipient of the Key Scientific Challenges Award from Yahoo! Research (2010), two best-of-conference citations (VLDB 2010 and KDD 2012), the Terry Groswith graduate fellowship at Stanford University (2007), and the Gold Medal in Computer Science at IIT Bombay (2007). Abstract: Fully automated algorithms are inadequate for a number of data analysis tasks, especially those involving images, video, or text. Thus, there is a need to combine “human computation” (or crowdsourcing), together with traditional computation, in order to improve the process of understanding and analyzing data. Aditya's thesis addresses several topics in the general area of human-powered data management. He designs algorithms and systems for combining human and traditional computation for: (a) data processing, e.g., using humans to help sort, cluster, or clean data; (b) data extraction, e.g., having humans help create structured data from information in unstructured web pages; and (c) data gathering, i.e., asking humans to provide data that they know about or can locate, but that would be difficult to gather automatically. His focus in all of these areas is to find solutions that expend as few resources as possible (e.g., time waiting, human effort, or money spent), while still providing high quality results. In this talk, Aditya will first present a broad perspective of our research on human-powered data management, and he will describe some systems and applications that have motivated our research. He will then present details of one of the problems we have addressed: filtering large data sets with the aid of humans. Finally Aditya will argue that human-powered data management is an area in its infancy, by describing a number of open problems he intends to address in my future research program.  "

He received his Ph.D. from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University in 2002. His research and teaching focus on using network analysis tools and sensors to understand and influence individual decision making. His research has won several best paper awards from the IEEE and the ACM. He also received the Eliahu I. Jury Award for best Ph.D. dissertation in 2002 . He is an associate editor for ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications and Applications and IEEE Multimedia. Abstract: Many of the pressing challenges facing contemporary society concern sustainability and public health. For example, how can sustainable behaviors—such as reducing individual energy consumption—be encouraged? How can participation in activities that reduce overall healthcare costs—such as compliance with preventive care routines and leading healthy lifestyles—be supported? Common to these challenges is a fundamental question: how can we facilitate cooperative behavior adoption on a large scale?  The conditions for self-governance found in small groups do not apply in large populations. As a result, the question of how cooperation can be facilitated in large populations remains unanswered and is the focus of Hari's work. In this talk, Hari shall discuss the computational tools needed—analysis of social signals from networks and knowledge of human activity from physical sensors—to engender cooperation in heterogenous populations. He shall discuss in depth our work on discovering homogenous groups. Central to our framework of cooperative behavior is the idea that individuals are resource constrained and these constraints affect how they participate in activities. Hari shall discuss two methods to influence cooperative behavioral adoption in such networks. Then, he shall present connections between information theory and network cooperation: designing signaling schemes to maximize influence and determining the social cooperative capacity of a group. In brief, Hari shall touch upon three data science challenges: efficient network sampling, compressive sensing of large scale structural change, and continuum network representations."

First, in the context of ad fraud, Dr. Gupta will describe the results from in situ experimentation with the largest online fraud infrastructure recently taken down by the FBI under ""Operation Ghost Click"". At the heart of this ad fraud scheme was a DNS changer malware, which helped the attackers hijack clicks and ad impressions on victim machines. The fraud affected 4 million users and made its perpetrators 14 million USD over a period of of four years. Next, in the context of privacy issues arising out of targeted advertising, she will present the design and analysis of a system that blocks ads based on the behavioral features of the JavaScript related to ads. In contrast, the state-of-the-art is based on URL-based regular expression matching, which requires tedious manual upkeep."

"Tuesday, October 29, 2013",3:00 pm,2405 Siebel Center,David Patterson: Myths about MOOCs and Software Engineering Education,"Bio: David Patterson is the Pardee Professor of Computer Science at the University of California at Berkeley, which he joined after graduating from UCLA in 1977. Dave's research style is to identify critical questions for the IT industry and gather inter-disciplinary groups of faculty and graduate students to answer them. The answer is typically embodied in demonstration systems, and these demonstration systems are later mirrored in commercial products. In addition to research impact, these projects train leaders of our field. The best known projects were Reduced Instruction Set Computers (RISC), Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID), and Networks of Workstations (NOW), each of which helped lead to billion dollar industries. A measure of the success of projects is the list of awards won by Patterson and as his teammates: the C & C Prize, the IEEE von Neumann Medal, the IEEE Johnson Storage Award, the SIGMOD Test of Time award, the ACM-IEEE Eckert-Mauchly Award, and the Katayanagi Prize. He was also elected to both AAAS societies, the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Sciences, the Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame, and to be a Fellow of the Computer History Museum. The full list includes about 35 awards for research, teaching, and service. In his spare time he coauthored six books, including two with John Hennessy, who is President of Stanford University. Patterson also served as Chair of the Computer Science Division at UC Berkeley, Chair of the Computing Research Association, and President of ACM. Abstract: This talk explains how the confluence of cloud computing and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have allowed us greatly improve both the effectiveness and the reach of UC Berkeley's undergraduate software engineering course. The first part of the talk is motivated by Industry's long-standing complaint that academia ignores vital software topics, leaving students unprepared upon graduation. Traditional approaches to software development are neither supported by tools that students could readily use, nor appropriate for projects whose scope matched a college course. Hence, instructors traditionally lecture about software engineering topics, while students continue to build software more or less the way they always had, in practice relegating software engineering to little more than a project course. This sad but stable state of affairs is frustrating to instructors, boring to students, and disappointing to industry. Happily, cloud computing and the shift in the software industry towards software as a service has led to highly-productive tools and techniques that are a much better match to the classroom than earlier software development methods. That is, not only has the future of software been revolutionized, it has changed in a way that makes it easier to teach.  UC Berkeley’s revised Software Engineering course leverages this productivity to allow students to both enhance a legacy application and to develop a new app that matches requirements of non-technical customers. By experiencing the whole software life cycle repeatedly within a single college course, students actually use the skills that industry has long encouraged and learn to appreciate them. The course is now rewarding for faculty, popular with students, and praised by industry. The second part of the talk is about our experience using MOOCs to teach Software Engineering. While the media's spotlight on MOOCs continues unabated, a recent opinion piece expresses grave concerns about their role (""Will MOOCs Destroy Academia?"", Moshe Vardi, CACM 55(11), Nov. 2012).  I will try to bust a few MOOC myths by presenting provocative, if anecdotal, evidence that appropriate use of MOOC technology can improve on-campus pedagogy, increase student throughput while raising course quality, and even reinvigorate faculty teaching. I'll also explain the role of MOOCs in enabling half-dozen universities to replicate and build upon our work via Small Private Online Courses (SPOCs) from EdX and our electronic textbook. I conclude that the 21st century textbook may prove to be a hybrid of SPOCs and Ebooks.    "

With the proliferation of data from sensors that are becoming ubiquitous and increasing digitization of data that used to be in non-electronic form, there are opportunities to completely transform the way the world is run. We present examples of such opportunities in the Financial, Healthcare, Education and Infrastructure domains. We also describe unique challenges like scale and heterogeneity in growth markets like India, which often require different approaches to solving these problems. Diving deeper into the healthcare industry, we present preliminary work that shows the applicability of remote sensing and data analytics not only to measure body vitals such as temperature and heart rate, but also to diagnose diseases such as breast cancer and atrial fibrillation (a form of cardiac arrhythmia) in the future. As more of the patients’ medical history gets captured in electronic health record systems, there is a further promise of applying real-time predictive analytics (based on accurate models for diagnosis and treatment of various diseases, utilizing the latest medical literature) to assist doctors in practicing personalized, evidence-based medicine. We describe outstanding challenges, including data privacy, machine learning over heterogeneous forms of data, and financial incentives design, which we believe must be addressed to enable transformational impact.

"Friday, November 01, 2013",3:30 pm,4405 SC,"Dr. Rahul Mangharam, Closing-the-loop with Cyber Physical System Modeling","Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems are the next generation of embedded systems with the tight integration of computing, communication and control of “messy” plants. I will describe our recent efforts in modeling for scheduling and control of closed-loop Cyber-Physical Systems across the domains of medical devices and energy-efficient buildings. In medical devices: the design of bug-free and safe software is challenging, especially in complex implantable devices that control and actuate organs whose response is not fully understood. Safety recalls of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators between 1990-2000 affected over 600,000 devices. Of these, 200,000 or 41%, were due to software issues that continue to increase in frequency. There is currently no formal methodology or open experimental platform to test and verify the correct operation of medical device software within the closed-loop context of the patient. I will describe our efforts to develop the foundations of formal modeling, synthesis and development of verified medical device software and systems from verified closed-loop models of the pacemaker and the heart. In buildings: heating, cooling and air quality control systems operate independently of each other and frequently result in temporally correlated energy demand surges. As peak power prices are 200-400 times that of the nominal rate, this uncoordinated activity is both expensive and operationally inefficient. While several approaches for load shifting and model predictive control have been proposed, we present alternative approaches for fine-grained coordination of energy demand by scheduling energy consuming control systems within a constrained peak power while ensuring custom climate environments are facilitated. By incorporating the dynamics of the plant in the scheduling scheme, we have developed a new class of scheduling for CPS, called Green Scheduling. With tools for integrated modeling and controls for energy-efficient buildings, we enable transfer of control algorithms from simulation to buildings in a systematic manner.

Since applications operate in terms of data and more end points become mobile, it becomes increasingly difficult and inefficient to satisfy IP’s requirement of determining exactly where (at which IP address) to find desired data. The Named Data Networking project (NDN) aims to carry the Internet into the future through a conceptually simple yet transformational architecture shift, from today's focus on where -- addresses and hosts -- to what -- the data that users and applications care about. By naming data instead of their locations, NDN transforms data into first-class entities, enabling direct security of data instead of data containers as well as radically scalable communication mechanisms such as multicast delivery and in-network storage. Bio: Lixia Zhang is a professor in the Computer Science Department of UCLA. She received Ph.D in computer science from MIT and was a member of the research staff at Xerox PARC before joining UCLA.

Large-scale phylogenetic estimation (whether of many taxa or smaller numbers but with full genomes) presents a wide range of ""Big Data"" issues, including data heterogeneity, missing data, hard optimization problems, and other challenges. In my lab, we have developed a number of new algorithmic approaches for handling large datasets, including novel divide-and-conquer strategies for co-estimating alignments, for estimating trees without alignments, for estimating species trees from multiple gene trees, and for taxon identification of metagenomic data. Some of these methods have strong statistical guarantees, while others show empirical advantages over existing methods. Finally, I will discuss the empirical challenges in analyzing real biological datasets.

However, despite the extensive existing literature on online learning, our theoretical understanding of the framework has been rather lacking. Most existing analyses have been case by case, and there is a lack of a general theory and methodology for designing online learning algorithms for the problem at hand. The goal of this talk is to first present a new general theory for online learning that parallels results from statistical learning theory. Next, building on this general theory, I will provide a generic recipe for deriving online learning algorithms.

Use of automated tools and fallible humans for data collection and integration, complex storage, and unreliable channels for data processing and communication all contribute to low quality of data. Since poor data quality can have serious consequences on the results of data analyses, the importance of veracity, the fourth 'V' of Big Data, is increasingly being recognized. The potential of Big Data cannot be realized unless we know how to detect, deal with and (possibly) repair the noisy and erroneous data. However the sheer volume, velocity and variety (the first three ʽVʼs) of Big Data pose unique challenges for algorithm design to deal with such data quality problems. In the first half of the talk, we concentrate on developing scalable algorithms (near-linear time) to repair semi-structured data, such as XML, popular for data interchange and storage. While a significant portion of Web data is XML, a large fraction of it is erroneous with the major source of errors being mismatch between open and close tags. This problem of repairing XML data leads to a broad class of problems that we call the ``Language Edit Distance Problemʼʼ: given a string σ over alphabet Σ and a grammar G defined over Σ, compute the minimum number of repairs, insertions, deletions and substitutions, that are required to map σ into a valid member of G. The language edit distance problem is a significant generalization of the widely used string edit distance problem and has many applications beyond data quality, in compiler optimization, natural language processing, biological sciences etc. The second half of the talk will explore how useful analytics may be done over noisy data when repairing is not possible. Ranking is a fundamental operation that arises in many different contexts, such as personalized recommender systems. Nevertheless, presence of noise in data makes even such basic operation complicated. We will provide a unified framework for efficiently ranking such uncertain data. In all these works, the probabilistic method and randomization play a crucial role from modeling data to developing algorithms. Bio: Barna Saha is a Senior Member of Technical Staff Research at AT&T-Shannon Labs where she joined after completing her Ph.D. from the University of Maryland College Park in 2011, working with Samir Khuller.

"Monday, March 17, 2014",10:00 am,2405 Siebel Center,"Richard Socher: ""Recursive Deep Learning for Modeling Compositional Meaning in Language""","Abstract: Great progress has been made in natural language processing thanks to many different algorithms, each often specific to one application. Most learning algorithms force language into simplified representations such as bag-of-words or fixed-sized windows or require human-designed features. I will introduce three models based on recursive neural networks that can learn linguistically plausible representations of language. These methods jointly learn compositional features and grammatical sentence structure for parsing or phrase level sentiment predictions. They can also be used to represent the visual meaning of a sentence which can be used to find images based on query sentences or to describe images with a more complex description than single object names. Besides the state-of-the-art performance, the models capture interesting phenomena in language such as compositionality. For instance, people easily see that the ""with"" phrase in ""eating spaghetti with a spoon"" specifies a way of eating whereas in ""eating spaghetti with some pesto"" it specifies the dish. I show that my model solves these prepositional attachment problems well thanks to its distributed representations. In sentiment analysis, a new tensor-based recursive model learns different types of high level negation and how they can change the meaning of longer phrases with many positive words. They also learn that when contrastive conjunctions such as ""but"" are used the sentiment of the phrases following them usually dominates. Bio: Richard Socher is a PhD student at Stanford working with Chris Manning and Andrew Ng. His research interests are machine learning for NLP and vision. He is interested in developing new deep learning models that learn useful features, capture compositional structure in multiple modalities and perform well across different tasks.

But while these online courses give teachers more coverage, student-teacher ratios can often be ten thousand to one or worse. With such ratios, students no longer get the type of feedback they need to really understand the material.Codewebs is a system that I have been developing which addresses the problem of scalability in providing student feedback for online programming-intensive courses. Codewebs analyzes a massive code corpora of historical student submissions and uses it to provide instant, useful and detailed student feedback to tens of thousands of students in the same course. By relying on a statistical approach, the quality of feedback increases as our system sees more data and the feedback is automatically tailored for each assignment. I will present a novel data driven technique to discover shared ""parts"" amongst multiple student submission, a problem that is complicated by the fact that there are always many ways to accomplish the same functionality in code. Throughout, I will demonstrate results on Coursera's Machine Learning course, which received over 1 million code submissions in its first run.Finally, I will highlight the emerging issues of scalability and sustainability of education, why these issues require insight from computer scientists and discuss specific problems in this domain that my future research program will address.

"Monday, April 07, 2014",10:00 am,2405 Siebel Center,"Jian Peng: ""Unraveling the Mechanism of Chaperone-Mediated Protein Folding""","Abstract: Chaperones are special proteins that aid in the folding, unfolding, assembly, and disassembly of other proteins. Chaperones rely on a large and diverse set of co-chaperones that regulate their specificity and function. How these co-chaperones regulate protein folding and whether they have chaperone-independent biological functions is largely unknown. In this talk, I will first present novel experimental and computational approaches to study the chaperone/co-chaperone/client interaction network in a systematic way. We delineated the relationship between the Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperone systems, uncovered novel co-chaperones and clients, and established a surprisingly distinct network of protein-protein interactions for co-chaperones. Our results provided a rich resource for exploring how this network changes in the context of development and disease. Finally, I will discuss a case study, a previously unresolved puzzle, on how Hsp90, a molecular chaperone, regulates the folding of protein kinases, possibly the most important drug targets for cancer therapy. Using computational graphical modeling and robust sparse regression methods, we identified striking associations between the binding specificity and a structural motif that includes deeply buried hydrophobic residues in the kinase core region. Computation-guided mutagenesis validated the role of this motif in binding and suggested that Hsp90 recognizes intermediate kinase conformations by sensing the thermostability of the kinase core region. We anticipate our new results will advance the understanding of the role of Hsp90 in cancer drug development.

"Thursday, April 10, 2014",10:00 am,2405 SC,"Mark Schmidt: ""Opening up the Optimization Black-Box for Large-Scale Machine Learning""","  Title: Opening up the Optimization Black-Box for Large-Scale Machine Learning Abstract: The way we solve optimization problems in machine learning is changing. Data sets are growing at a tremendous rate, models are becoming increasingly complex, and non-smooth objective functions are now common. This is particularly true for structured prediction problems where we analyze objects like sequences, images, and graphs (unlike traditional machine learning methods like support vector machine that focus on single class labels). Unfortunately, traditional black-box optimization techniques are increasingly unable to cope with these challenges. My research focuses on `opening up the black box', by developing methods that take advantage of the structures present in machine learning optimization problems. This simple idea can lead to enormous reductions in computation, and in extreme cases a polynomial-time algorithm was developed in a context where all black-box algorithms provably require exponential time. In this talk I will present (i) my work on inexact proximal-gradient methods for optimization with complex non-smooth sparsity-inducing regularizers, (ii) my work on projected quasi-Newton methods for optimizing costly objective functions with simple constraints, and (iii) my work on the first polynomial-time stochastic gradient method for optimization when the number of data points is enormous. The large gains achieved by these methods make it practical to analyze significantly larger data sets, and also allow us to fit more complicated models. These types of advances have proven useful for a wide variety of applications in machine learning, but the work has broader implications since these same problem structures tend to arise in most data-driven science and engineering applications. Biography: Mark Schmidt works in the Natural Language Laboratory at Simon Fraser University. From 2011 through 2013 he worked at the École normale supérieure in Paris on inexact and stochastic convex optimization methods. He finished his M.Sc. in 2005 at the University of Alberta working as part of the Brain Tumor Analysis Project, and his Ph.D. in 2010 at the University of British Columbia working on graphical model structure learning with L1-regularization. He has also worked at Siemens Medical Solutions on heart motion abnormality detection, and with Michael Friedlander in the Scientific Computing Laboratory at the University of British Columbia on semi-stochastic optimization methods.

Linear regression is one of the most widely used methods for prediction and forecasting, with widespread uses in many fields such as natural sciences, economy, and medicine. I will show how to improve the information costs of linear regression in two settings. First, I will present a new estimation algorithm for the standard supervised regression setting. This is the first efficient estimator that enjoys minimax optimal sample complexity, up to log factors, for general heavy tailed distributions. The technique is general and can be applied to a larger class of smooth and strongly convex losses. Second, I will consider the challenge of using crowdsourcing for labeling in tasks that usually require experts, and show how to achieve this using linear regression combined with a feature multi-selection approach. Based on joint work with Daniel Hsu and Adam Kalai. Bio: Sivan Sabato is a post-doctoral researcher at Microsoft Research New England.

Clark St., Urbana, IL",Serial Innovators: How Individuals Create and Deliver Breakthrough Innovation in Mature Firms,"Bruce Vojak, University of Illinois Associate Dean of Engineering, will give a talk on his book, ""Serial Innovators: How Individuals Create and Deliver Breakthrough Innovation in Mature Firms."" The book zeros in on the cutting-edge thinkers who repeatedly create and deliver breakthrough innovations and new products in large, mature organizations. These employees are organizational powerhouses who solve consumer problems and substantially contribute to the financial value to their firms. In this pioneering study, authors Abbie Griffin, Raymond L. Price, and Bruce A. Vojak detail who these serial innovators are and how they develop novel products, ranging from salt-free seasonings to improved electronics in companies such as Alberto Culver, Hewlett-Packard, and Procter & Gamble. Based on interviews with over 50 serial innovators and an even larger pool of their co-workers, managers and human resources teams, the authors reveal key insights about how to better understand, emulate, enable, support, and manage these unique and important individuals for long-term corporate success. Interestingly, the book finds that serial innovators are instrumental both in cases where firms are aware of clear market demands, and in scenarios when companies take risks on new investments, creating a consumer need. For over 25 years, research on innovation has taken the perspective that new product development can be managed like any other (complex) process of the firm. While a highly structured and closely supervised approach is helpful in creating incremental innovations, this book finds that it is not conducive to creating breakthrough innovations. The text argues that the drive to routinize innovation has gone too far; in fact, so far as to limit many mature firms' ability to create breakthrough innovations. In today's economy, with the future of so many large firms on the line, this book is a clarion call to businesses to rethink how to nurture and thrive on their innovative workforce.The talk will be followed by a poster session at which NCSA’s undergraduate interns will present their projects. Refreshments will be served."
"Thursday, May 01, 2014",10:00 am,2405 Siebel Center,"Alvin Cheung: ""Rethinking the Application-Database Interface""","*This talk was has been rescheduled from May 5 to May 1. Abstract: From social networking websites to bank transactions, we interact with data-intensive applications every day. Such applications are typically hosted on an application server that interacts with a database server to manipulate persistent data. To make such applications efficient, developers face the daunting task of mastering the intricacies of both the programming system and the database management system. For instance, while many application features can be implemented in either the application or pushed into the database, it is difficult for a programmer to decide where to place a given computation as the decision is typically workload-driven. Unfortunately, making the wrong choice often results in drastic performance hit. In this talk, I will show how examining both the programming system and the database management system at the same time allows us to significantly improve the performance of data-intensive applications. To illustrate such cross-system optimization opportunities, I have designed, built, and evaluated three systems: Query By Synthesis, a tool that converts functionality written as imperative code into relational queries; Sloth, a system that combines queries embedded in applications into batches; and Pyxis, a system that seamlessly moves computation between application and database servers. Using real-world examples, I will show that these systems allow orders of magnitude performance improvement and graceful adaptation to changing server environments while preserving the high-level programming interface to the developer. My work has been featured in ACM Tech News and included in graduate seminar courses. We have also received requests from more than 50 individuals and institutions who are interested in trying out our tools. Bio: Alvin Cheung is a PhD candidate at MIT. His research interests include applying program analysis and synthesis techniques to help developers implement and optimize large software systems. Alvin has also done research in programming mobile phones and building software development tools, and has previously won the best paper award at CIDR.

In fields where the data is ""found"" rather than ""taken"", or where data involves privacy considerations, there are challenges that don't fit this paradigm well. Nevertheless, some themes still apply widely, such as how to handle sparse and incomplete data, how to find hidden patterns, how to assess the significance of conclusions, and how to design new technologies to get more data. New data science research institutes in the USA and Europe are being set up to exploit these common themes, and it will be interesting to see what connections arise between established big-data fields and new ones."

These are and continue to be important areas of study, but computing and algorithms can also become the object of journalism. Algorithms adjudicate a large array of decisions in our lives: not just search engines and personalized online news systems, but educational evaluations, markets and political campaigns, and the management of social services like welfare and public safety. A new form of computational journalism that I call “Algorithmic Accountability Reporting” is emerging to apply the core journalistic functions of watchdogging and accountability reporting to algorithms. In this talk I will provide some perspective on the tool-oriented roots of computational journalism, and then discuss how algorithmic accountability reporting is emerging as a mechanism for articulating the power structures, biases, and influences that computational artifacts play in society.

Besides brut-force computational power, algorithms are evolving quickly. Inparticular, deep neural networks provide impressive classification results for many types of signals, images and data sets. It is thus time to wonder what type of information is extracted by these network architectures, and why they work so well. Learning does not seem to be the key element of this story. Multirate filter banks together with non-linearities can compute multiscale invariants, which appear to provide stable representations of complex geometric structures and random processes. This will be illustrated through audio and imageclassification problems. We also show that such architectures can learn complex physical functionals, such as quantum chemistry energies.   Dr. Mallat has collaborated with Yves Meyer to develop the Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) construction for compactly supported wavelets, which made the implementation of wavelets practical for engineering applications by demonstrating the equivalence of wavelet bases and conjugate mirror filters used in discrete, multirate filter banks in signal processing. He also developed (with Sifen Zhong) the Wavelet transform modulus maxima method for image characterization, a method that uses the local maxima of the wavelet coefficients at various scales to reconstruct images. He introduced the scattering transform that constructs invariance for object recognition purposes.

"Thursday, October 23, 2014",12:00 pm,2405 Siebel Center,"Dr. Koushik Sen: ""MultiSE: Multi-Path Symbolic Execution using Value Summaries""","Abstract: Concolic testing of dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) has been proposed recently to effectively generate test inputs for real-world programs. Unfortunately, concolic testing techniques do not scale well for large realistic programs, because often the number of feasible execution paths of a program increases exponentially with the increase in the length of an execution path. In this talk, I will describe MultiSE, a new technique for merging states incrementally during symbolic execution, without using auxiliary variables. The key idea of MultiSE is based on an alternative representation of the state, where we map each variable, including the program counter, to a set of guarded symbolic expressions called a value summary. MultiSE has several advantages over conventional DSE and state merging techniques: 1) value summaries enable sharing of symbolic expressions and path constraints along multiple paths, 2) value-summaries avoid redundant execution, 3) MultiSE does not introduce auxiliary symbolic values, which enables it to make progress even when merging values not supported by the constraint solver, such as floating point or function values. We have implemented MultiSE for JavaScript programs in a publicly available open-source tool . Our evaluation of MultiSE on several programs shows that MultiSE can run significantly faster than traditional symbolic execution.

"Thursday, October 23, 2014",1:30 pm,2405 Siebel Center,"Dr. Jason Cong: ""Accelerator-Rich Architectures — From Single-chip  to Datacenters""","Abstract: In order to drastically improve energy efficiency, we believe that future processor architectures will make extensive use of accelerators from single-chip implementation to datacenter-level integration, as custom-designed accelerators often provide 10-1000X performance/energy efficiency over the general-purpose processors [1]. Such an accelerator-rich architecture presents a fundamental departure from the classical von Neumann architecture, which emphasizes efficient sharing of the executions of different instructions on a common pipeline, providing an elegant solution when the computing resource is scarce. In constrast, the accelerator-rich architecture features heterogeneity and customizaiton for energy efficiency, which is better suited for energy-constrained design where the silicon resource is abundant. There are several concerns with the extensive usage of accelerators: (1) low utilization, (2) narrow workload coverage, (3) high design cost, and (4) unfamiliar programming interfaces. In this talk, I shall discuss recent progress and ongoing work to address these concerns. Due to tight power and thermal budgets, only a fraction of computing elements on-chip can be active in future technologies (so called dark silicon [2]). This means low utilization (but much higher energy efficiency) will be an inherent characteristic of future chips. To address the problem of narrow workload coverage, we look to the use of composable accelerators and programmable fabrics to virtualize and accelerate larger blocks of computation [3]. The design cost can properly managed by leveraing the recent advances in high-level synthesis coupled with efficient parameterized architecture template generation. The programming interface is a critical issue for successful adaption of accelerator-rich architectures. It needs to support extensive use of accelerators from single-chip to datacenter scales [4]. We have made significant progress in compilation and runtime support to enable programmers to make use the existing programming interfaces (e.g. C/C++ for computation tasks and MapReduce or Hadoop for large-scale distributed computation in datacenters) for efficient use of accelerators at all scales.

In this talk, I will describe how such frameworks emerge from the methods of efficient data representation. Consider the Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) problem—a ubiquitous massive datasets problem that is of key importance in machine learning and other areas. Its goal is to preprocess a dataset of objects (e.g., images) so that later, given a new query object, one can efficiently return the object most similar to the query. Efficient solutions may be achieved via Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), a data representation tool that has seen a lot of success in both theory and practice. I will start by presenting the best possible LSH-based algorithm for NNS under the Euclidean distance. Then, I will show a new approach that, for the first time, provably outperforms the LSH-based algorithms. Taking a broader perspective, I will describe other examples where the lens of ""efficient data representation"" leads to new efficient algorithms. These examples include fast algorithms for estimating the edit distance and the Earth-Mover Distance, as well as a new algorithmic framework for parallel models of computation (such as MapReduce).

All these contribute to significant scalability problems. We describe a collection of results that address several aspects of these problems - by carefully selecting and caching samples, structures, or latent items. Our results lead to efficient learning algorithms for structured prediction models and for online clustering models which, in turn, support reduction in problem size, improvements in training and evaluation speed and improved performance.

"Thursday, February 12, 2015",10:00 am,2405 Siebel Center,"Jan Hoffmann: ""Formal Reasoning about Quantitative Properties of Software""","Abstract: Quantitative properties such as execution time, memory consumption, and power usage determine whether a software system is useful in practice. A precise understanding of quantitative properties of software is also essential to ensure safety (e.g., no stack overflow) and security (e.g., no side-channel vulnerabilities). Yet, it is still hard to reason about quantitative characteristics of software at development time. In this talk, I will present novel techniques for modeling and analyzing quantitative properties of software. These techniques are designed to meet two major challenges of quantitative analyses: precision and compositionality. First, I will present polynomial amortized resource analysis (PARA), a static analysis system for automatically deriving worst-case resource bounds which are parametric in the input sizes of programs. The analysis can be integrated in a type system (for functional programs) or a Hoare logic (for imperative programs). A novel algebraic structure, which we call multivariate resource polynomials, enables the reduction of bound inference to efficient LP solving. PARA is naturally compositional and derives bounds for a wide range of non-trivial programs. Experiments with implementations of PARA in the programming language Resource Aware ML and in the tool C4B for C programs demonstrate that the analysis is precise, efficient, and reliable. Second, I will briefly describe two applications of the ideas of PARA to real-world problems: (1) a quantitative reasoning technique for proving lock freedom of concurrent data structures and (2) a framework for deriving formally verified stack-space bounds for compiled x86 assembly code at the C level. Finally, I will talk about future projects that use quantitative methods to reason about privacy and security.

Chips in these systems comprise multiple processing cores (10-100 today, perhaps 1000s in future) running one or more applications in parallel. Ideally, any pair of these cores communicating with each other should have a dedicated communication link between them. But this design philosophy is not scalable beyond a few cores; instead chips use a shared network, with routers at cross points to facilitate the multiplexing of links across message flows. These routers add multiple cycles of delay at every hop of the traversal. As Moore’s Law continues and we add more cores (both homogeneous and heterogeneous) on the chip, the average number of hops and the correspondingly network delay goes up, strongly limiting scalability. Conventional wisdom thus argues to keep communication to a minimum, which requires expensive software and hardware optimizations. In this talk, we challenge this conventional wisdom. We present network-on-chip (NoC) designs that can achieve near single-cycle traversals across the chip for both unicast and collective (1-to-Many and Many-to-1) communication flows, approaching the performance of an ""ideal"" but impractical all-to-all connected network. The focus of the talk will be on SMART*: a technique that enables messages to traverse multiple-hops, potentially all the way from the source to the destination, within a single-cycle, over a NoC with shared links. SMART leverages repeated wires in the datapath, which can traverse 10+ mm at a GHz frequency. We present a reconfiguration methodology to allow different message flows to reserve multiple links (with turns) within one cycle and traverse them in the next. SMART reduces average network latency by 5-8x across traffic patterns as compared to a state-of-the-art network with single-cycle routers at every hop on a 64-core chip. The talk will also cover some interesting research opportunities leveraging SMART to (a) design locality-oblivious memory systems, and (b) build specialized hardware by reconfiguring a spatial array of processing elements. These directions align with the emerging trend of specialized accelerators complementing the general-purpose cores as we scale to an era of exascale computing. *Single-cycle Multi-hop Asynchronous Repeated Traversal Speaker Bio: Tushar Krishna received a PhD in electrical engineering and computer science from MIT in 2014, advised by Prof. Li-Shiuan Peh.

At the same time, their limitations have emerged. Such limitations are typically NP-hardness results or hard instances for a particular convex relaxation. In this talk, I will discuss the interplay between these two kinds of limitations, and what new results may be discovered by looking at these limitations side by side. Central to these hardness results will be the approximability of constraint satisfaction problems. Numerous such NP-hardness results rely on a complexity assumption, known as the Unique-Games Conjecture. The belief in this conjecture is somewhat shaken in light of recent advances.

These services are often virtualized, and they can handle the computing needs of big data analytics. The ever-growing demand for cloud services arises in many areas including healthcare, transportation, energy systems, and manufacturing. However, cloud resources such as computing power, storage, energy, dollars for infrastructure, and dollars for operations, are limited. Effective use of the existing resources is a fundamental challenge that places the cloud resource management at the heart of the cloud providers’ decision-making process. In this talk, I will discuss my research work that addresses this fundamental challenge. First, I will present the design of optimal and approximation mechanisms for Virtual Machine provisioning, allocation, and pricing in clouds. The proposed mechanisms are designed to adapt to changing conditions (i.e., users requests) and to lead the system into an equilibrium in which users have incentives to report their resource requests and valuations truthfully. Then, I will present the design of an energy-aware MapReduce scheduling algorithm for big data applications. The proposed scheduling algorithm finds a detailed task placement of a MapReduce job minimizing the energy required for its execution. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to find near optimal job schedules consuming approximately 30% less energy on average than the schedules obtained by a common practice scheduler that minimizes the makespan.

However, in terms of theoretical guarantees on the accuracy and stability to noise, our understanding is still quite limited. Given the growing use of learning algorithms in applications, these aspects are becoming increasingly important. This raises the question: can we design algorithms for these problems that come with guarantees, at least under some assumptions? I will describe two results in this direction. The first is on learning the parameters of latent variable models (such as hidden Markov models, topic models, Gaussian mixtures, etc). I will show how classical results on the decomposition of tensors (higher dimensional arrays) lead to new learning algorithms. These algorithms can be proved to recover the parameters accurately and efficiently, in a ""smoothed analysis"" framework. Next, I will talk about learning multi-layered neural networks, often referred to as representation learning or deep learning. I will show that an algorithm based on the classical ""Hebbian"" principle can (provably and efficiently) recover the parameters of the neural network, under certain structural assumptions. The algorithm makes a surprising use of overlapping clustering in order to recover the edges in the network.

"Tuesday, March 03, 2015",10:00 am,2405 Siebel Center,"Guy Van den Broeck: ""Scalable Inference and Learning for High-Level Probabilistic Models""","Abstract: Probabilistic graphical models are pervasive in AI and machine learning. A recent push, however, is towards more high-level representations of uncertainty, such as probabilistic programs, probabilistic databases, and statistical relational models. This move is akin to going from hardware circuits to a full-fledged programming language, and poses key challenges for inference and learning. For instance, we encounter a fundamental limitation of classical learning algorithms: they make strong independence assumptions about the entities in the data (e.g., images, web pages, patients, etc.). These assumptions fail to hold in a global view of the data, where all entities are related. We also encounter a limitation of existing reasoning algorithms, which fail to scale to large, densely connected graphical models, consisting of millions of interrelated entities.  In this talk, I present my research on efficient algorithms for high-level probabilistic models, called lifted inference and learning algorithms. I begin by introducing the key principles behind exact lifted inference, namely to exploit symmetry and exchangeability in the model. Next, I discuss the strengths and limitations of lifting. Building on results from database theory and counting complexity, I identify classes of tractable models, and classes where high-level reasoning is fundamentally hard. I conclude by showing the practical embodiment of these ideas, in the form of approximate inference and learning algorithms that scale up to big data and big models.

Classical optimization algorithms usually cannot scale up due to huge amount of data and/or model parameters. In this talk, I will show that the scalability issues can often be resolved by exploiting three types of structure in machine learning problems: problem structure, model structure, and data distribution. This central idea can be applied to many machine learning problems, including kernel machines for classification or regression, matrix factorization for recommender systems, and structure learning for graphical models.  To demonstrate this central idea, I will describe a Newton-like algorithm for solving the L1-regularized Gaussian maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). This estimator has strong statistical guarantee in recovering a sparse inverse covariance, but requires solving a difficult non-smooth log-determinant program with number of parameters that scale quadratically with number of random variables. State-of-the-art methods thus cannot handle more than 20,000 random variables. I will present a Newton-like algorithm for solving this problem. By exploiting structure of problem, model, and data distribution, our proposed algorithm can solve 1 million dimensional L1-regularized Gaussian MLE (which has 1 trillion parameters) in one day using a single machine.

In this talk I will discuss one of the most important solution concepts in game theory, namely Nash equilibrium, for its computational and application aspects. Recently a remarkable connection was discovered between evolution under sexual reproduction and coordination games. Proceeding along these lines I will show some new insights on genetic diversity. Towards efficient computation, finding Nash equilibrium in two-player normal form game (2-Nash) is one of the most extensively studied problems. Such a game can be represented by two payoff matrices A and B, one for each player. 2-Nash is PPAD-complete in general, while in case of zero-sum games (B=-A) the problem reduces to LP and hence is in P. Extending the notion of zero-sum, in 2005, Kannan and Theobald defined rank of game (A, B) as rank(A+B), e.g., rank-0 are zero-sum games. They asked for an efficient algorithm for constant rank games, where the primary difficulty was disconnected solution set, even in rank-1 games. I will answer this question affirmatively for rank-1 games, and negatively for games with rank three or more (unless PPAD=P); the status of rank-2 games remains unresolved. In the process I obtain a number of other results, including a simpler proof of PPAD-hardness for 2-Nash.

A crucial system component to achieve this goal is the cluster manager; the system that orchestrates where applications are placed and how many resources they receive.

However, In 1990’s it has been observed that it is difficult or even impossible to abstract certain kinds of behavior of software using hierarchical composition of modules because of code tangling and scattering. Examples of such behavior are monitoring, security, synchronization and error handling. To be able to structure such behavior, different kinds of techniques have been proposed, such as patterns, reflection and open implementations, generative programming, model-driven engineering and aspect-oriented programming (AOP). In particular AOP languages offer flexible ways in non-hierarchical composition of modules. This talk will elaborate on these approaches and identify their problems. In particular, AOP languages have problems in handling “complex behavioral patterns” and “emergent behavior” which are quite common in today’s applications. The talk will further focus on the desired first-class abstractions of the languages and argue that the concept of “events”, “actions” and “compositions” should outline the boundaries of computational units of languages. Finally, these three concepts will be illustrated by a set of examples.   Bio: Mehmet Akşit and the members of the Software Engineering Chair were among the pioneers of the following techniques:   (a)  Since 1988, the group has developed, probably the first aspect-oriented language called Sina, which has later evolved into Composition Filters. It has some unique features such as language independence, “interface-programming”, domain specific aspects and a large set of verification tools. The group has organized the first Aspect-Oriented Software Development conference (AOSD2002) and Aksit has been the co-editor of the first aspect-oriented journal. Currently, Aksit is working on event-based languages to model and implement emergent behavior in large systems. (b) Since begin 90’s, the group has developed synthesis based architecture/software design, which adopts controlled problem solving techniques in designing software architectures. Currently, Aksit is working on software synthesis and composition techniques in certain safety-critical application domains. (c)  Since 1994, the group has applied, probably for the first time, fuzzy-logic based techniques to modeling software design heuristics and processes. Recently, these techniques have been extended by fuzzy-probabilistic methods and applied to software process and product optimization problems. (d) Since 1997, the group has been developing new design formalisms to evaluate various software metrics. For this purpose around 2000 the concept of Design Algebra was introduced. Later, the group has worked on new software metrics such as adaptability, evolvability, documentability, fault-tolerance, integrate-ability (dealing with semantic interference), traceability, relevance. Currently, Aksit is supervising a large industry research project that combines multiple verification techniques together, such as model-checking, fault-tolerance and run-time verification (aim is without creating unnecessary overhead of adopting many models and techniques).   Aksit is working in the identification of research needs of some large high-technology companies and setting up a university research consortium in Europe among 21 researchers.

My work is concerned with designing algorithms that aim to bring this ability to robots and simulated characters. A central challenge in this field is to learn behaviors with representations that are sufficiently general and expressive to handle the wide range of motion skills that are necessary for real-world applications, such as general-purpose household robots. These representations must also be able to operate on raw, high-dimensional inputs and outputs, such as camera images, joint torques, and muscle activations. I will describe a class of guided policy search algorithms that tackle this challenge by transforming the task of learning control policies into a supervised learning problem, with supervision provided by simple, efficient trajectory-centric methods. I will show how this approach can be applied to a wide range of tasks, from locomotion and push recovery to robotic manipulation. I will also present new results on using deep convolutional neural networks to directly learn policies that combine visual perception and control, learning the entire mapping from rich visual stimuli to motor torques on a real robot. I will conclude by discussing future directions in deep sensorimotor learning and how advances in this emerging field can be applied to a range of other areas.  Bio Sergey Levine is a postdoctoral researcher working with Professor Pieter Abbeel at UC Berkeley. He completed his PhD in 2014 with Vladlen Koltun at Stanford University. His research focuses on robotics, machine learning, and computer graphics. In his PhD thesis, he developed a novel guided policy search algorithm for learning rich, expressive locomotion policies. In later work, this method enabled learning a range of robotic manipulation tasks, as well as end-to-end training of policies for perception and control. He has also developed algorithms for learning from demonstration, inverse reinforcement learning, and data-driven character animation."

Some of the most surprising and invasive threats to materialize in recent years are brought about by so-called inference attacks: successful attempts to learn sensitive information by leveraging public data such as social network updates, published research articles, and web APIs. In this talk, I will focus on two of my research efforts to better understand and defend against these attacks. First I will discuss work that examines the privacy risks that arise when machine learning models are used in a popular medical application, and illustrate the consequences of applying differential privacy as a defense. This work uncovered a new type of inference attack on machine learning models, and shows via an in-depth case study how to understand privacy ""in situ"" by balancing the attacker's chance of success against the likelihood of harmful medical outcomes. The second part of the talk will detail work that helps developers correctly write privacy-aware applications using verification tools. I will illustrate how a wide range of confidentiality guarantees can be framed in terms of a new logical primitive called Satisfiability Modulo Counting, and describe a tool that I have developed around this primitive that automatically finds privacy bugs in software (or proves that the software is bug-free). Through a better understanding of how proposed defenses impact real applications, and by providing tools that help developers implement the correct defense for their task, we can begin to proactively identify potential threats to privacy and take steps to ensure that they will not surface in practice.

As the sizes of modern datasets grow, however, many classical polynomial time (and sometimes even linear time) solutions become prohibitively expensive. This calls for sublinear algorithms, i.e. algorithms whose resource requirements are substantially smaller than the size of the input that they operate on.  In this talk, we describe a new approach to the problem of approximating the size of maximum matching in a large graph given as a stream of edge updates using sublinear space. The matching problem is one of the most well-studied questions in combinatorial optimization, and has important applications in modern big data analysis (e.g. online advertising). We obtain a polylogarithmic approximation to maximum matching size using space sublinear in the number of *vertices* in the graph and exponentially smaller than previously known. This is the first algorithm for a graph problem that achieves truly sublinear space in the streaming setting, suggesting the possibility of a new class of more efficient graph analysis primitives.

Michael obtained his PhD from Stanford University in 2012, after which he spent two years as a postdoc in the Theory of Computation Group at MIT CSAIL.

He has worked on various questions in theoretical foundations of big data analysis: algorithms for solving graph problems on massive inputs that achieve sublinear runtime, can operate under tight restrictions on space (streaming algorithms) and communication (sketching algorithms) or can deal with uncertainty in future inputs (online algorithms).

Meaningful analysis of such high-dimensional datasets must incorporate knowledge gleaned from expertise, experimental evidence, and statistical considerations. In particular, restricting the degrees of freedom via sparsity or low rank structure has become an important design paradigm, enabling the recovery of parsimonious and interpretable results, and improving storage and prediction efficiency for high-dimensional problems. I will describe a novel family of methods for scalable probabilistic inference with structured variables. The approach is based on analyzing the information projection of probability distributions to structured sets. When applied to variable selection, the information projection corresponds to a submodular optimization. As a result, greedy forward selection is efficient with strong optimization guarantees on the quality of the solution. I will then outline some recent successes of the proposed family of methods in neuroimaging data analysis, including voxel selection for decoding task fMRI and sparse PCA for exploratory analysis of resting state fMRI.

"Thursday, March 19, 2015",10:00 am,2405 Siebel Center,"Vijay Chidambaram: ""Performance and Reliability in Modern Storage Systems""","Abstract: Storage services form the platform on which widely used cloud services, mobile applications, data analytics engines, and transactional databases are built. Such services are trusted with irreplaceable personal and commercial information by users, companies, and even governments. The designers of storage services often have to choose between performance and reliability. If the developer makes the system reliable, performance is often significantly reduced. If the developer instead maximizes performance, a crash could lead to data loss and corruption. In this talk, I describe how to build systems that achieve both strong reliability and high performance. In many systems, reliability is maintained by carefully ordering updates to storage. The key insight is that the low-level mechanism used to enforce ordering is overloaded: it provides durability as well as ordering. I introduce a new primitive, osync(), that decouples ordering from durability of writes. I present Optimistic Crash Consistency, a new crash-recovery protocol that builds on osync() to provide strong reliability guarantees and high performance. I implement these techniques in the Optimistic File System (OptFS) and show that it provides 10X increased performance for some workloads. With researchers in Microsoft, I employ the principles of Optimistic Crash Consistency in a distributed storage system, resulting in 2-5X performance improvements.

My research seeks to get the most out of approximate computing using collaboration between software and hardware. In hardware, I have proposed CPU designs, accelerators, and storage systems that can gracefully trade off quality for efficiency. In software, I have designed type systems, debugging tools, compilers, and a language construct called a probabilistic assertion for controlling approximation's impact.

This should be no surprise: not only are users sharing more information, but there is a growing amount of code that handles sensitive data. Unless we make it easier to create secure programs, information leaks will only get worse.  I present a language, Jeeves, where programs preserve privacy and security properties by construction. In Jeeves, the programmer specifies expressive information flow policies separately from other functionality and relies on the language runtime to automatically differentiate behavior. Jeeves is the first language to factor out information flow, preventing information leaks by reducing the opportunity for programmer error. To help programmers reason about Jeeves programs, I defined what it means for Jeeves to enforce programmer-specified policies and proved that Jeeves correctly does so. To demonstrate the feasibility of this programming model in practice, I implemented Jeeves in Scala and Python and created Jacqueline, a Jeeves-based web framework that enforces policies end-to-end. I describe how I used Jacqueline to implement a course manager, a health record manager, and a conference management system that has been used for an academic workshop.

Differential Privacy promises to minimize these risks by ensuring that the presence or absence of a single individual’s data has negligible statistical effect on the result of a data analysis. However, manually checking that a given data analysis is differentially private is difficult and requires advanced domain expertise.  In this talk, I will show how programming languages can be used to develop data analyses that are differentially private by construction. I will present the ideas behind the design of two programming languages for differential privacy: DFuzz and HOARe2. These languages are based on rich type systems implementing two different techniques to formally check whether a data analysis is differentially private or not.  The application of the techniques implemented in these languages extends beyond Differential Privacy.

As the data is on the order of petabytes, current search engines are very large centralized systems based on replicated clusters. Web data, however, is always evolving.

On the other hand, Internet users are above two billion and hundreds of millions of queries are issued each day. In the near future, centralized systems are likely to become less effective against such a data-query load, suggesting the need of fully distributed search engines.  Such engines need to maintain high-quality answers, fast response time, high query throughput, high availability, and scalability, in spite of network latency and scattered data.

This brings up the question of how theory can best contribute to our understanding of algorithms for such problems when worst-case analysis is too pessimistic and simple probabilistic models are, on the other hand, too optimistic or just inappropriate. In this talk I will discuss a few vignettes, centered around problems of clustering, finding equilibria, and privacy-preserving data analysis. One theme in part of this work is that often when AI problems such as clustering are formulated as optimization tasks, the objective being optimized is really a proxy for some other underlying goal. In such cases, implicitly assumed connections between the proxy and underlying goal (which one would want to hold for the formulation to be reasonable) will sometimes imply additional structure that algorithms can use to bypass worst-case approximation barriers.

"Friday, May 01, 2015",10:00 am,2405 Siebel Center,"Dr. Baishakhi Ray: ""Leveraging Big Software Data to Improve Software Quality""","Abstract: Improving software quality has been one of the primary concerns of programming language (PL) and software engineering (SE) research over decades. Researchers developed different techniques, e.g., new languages, automatic bug finding tools, code review processes, etc. to reduce defects. However, there is no evidence to indicate how well these techniques work in real software development scenario. In this talk, I will demonstrate how the abundant archived data from GitHub can be used to evaluate different SE/PL methods. I will also discuss how such empirical insights can further be leveraged to build new development tools to improve software quality and programmer productivity. In this talk, I will discuss some of my work that analyze different aspects of existing software engineering practices. First, I will describe how a choice of programming language affects software quality. Studying the 728 most popular GitHub projects, written in 17 different languages, we found that language did have a significant effect on certain kinds of defects. Second, I will show what kinds of bugs are caused by copy and paste and how do we detect them automatically? Finally, I will discuss the current adversarial testing practices in different SSL/TLS implementations and demonstrate a practical approach to automatically detect security vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS certificate validation code. Bio: Baishakhi Ray is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Davis. She finished her PhD in 2013 from the University of Texas at Austin. Her research focuses on software engineering, in particular, empirical studies, program analysis, and software evolution.

"Thursday, May 28, 2015",2:00 pm,2405 Siebel Center,"Dr. Dana Moshkovitz: ""Hard Problems in Hardness of Approximation: Sharp Thresholds, Parallel Repetition and Unique Games""","Abstract: Many of the optimization problems of interest to humanity are NP-hard, and most computer scientists believe that they have no efficient algorithms. Focusing on approximation rather than exact optimization might extend the reach of algorithmic technique into the intractable. However, for many NP-hard problems, approximating them better than a problem-dependent threshold turns out to be NP-hard as well. Proving so rigorously is a difficult task, which—by a leap of thought—leads to fundamental questions about the nature of proofs and their verification. In this talk I'll discuss the phenomenon of sharp thresholds in approximability, namely, how many approximation problems transform instantly from efficiently solvable to exponentially hard as one focuses on a better approximation (joint work with Ran Raz). I'll discuss two prover games and a new, incredibly simple, method (""fortification"") for analyzing their parallel repetition. Finally, I'll discuss a recent candidate hard instance for unique games, which might lead to progress on the Unique Games Conjecture—one of the biggest open problems in approximability (joint work with Subhash Khot). Bio: Dana Moshkovitz is an assistant professor of computer science at MIT. Her research is in theoretical computer science, and much of it focuses on the limitations of approximation algorithms and probabilistic checking of proofs. Dana did her PhD at the Weizmann Institute in Israel. Her thesis co-won the Nessyahu Prize for best math PhD thesis in Israel in 2009, and part of this work was awarded the FOCS 2008 Best paper. Dana went on to spend a couple of years at Princeton University and the Institute of Advanced Study before joining MIT in the end of 2010.

Unlike other fields, despite this harmony there is no open alternative to proprietary offerings from ARM and Intel. Thus, we propose the RISC-V, which targets Systems on a Chip (SoC). It has   A small base of <50 classic RISC instructions, which runs the full open-source software stack. Opcodes reserved for tailoring an SoC to applications. Instruction extensions optionally included in a SoC. No cost; no paperwork; anyone can use it. Openness to feedback and revision before announcement vs. afterwards. A foundation to evolve the RISC-V slowly based solely on technical reasons determined by voting members.  We then describe 10 RISC-V chips that were built using Agile methods in a new hardware design language (Chisel), which reduces development effort by greatly increasing reuse. Bio: David Patterson joined UC Berkeley nearly 40 years ago. He has been Director of several research labs, chair of Berkeley’s CS Division, chair of the Computing Research Association, and president of ACM. His most successful projects are likely Reduced Instruction Set Computers (RISC), Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID), and Network of Workstations (NOW), all of which helped lead to multibillion-dollar industries. This research led to many papers, six books, and about 35 honors for him and his friends, including election to the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame. He also shared the IEEE von Neumann Medal and the NEC C&C Prize with John Hennessy, co-author of two of his books and president of Stanford University."

"Monday, October 12, 2015",4:00 pm,2405 Siebel Center,"Christopher Batten: ""Architectural Specialization for Inter-Iteration Loop Dependence Patterns""","Abstract: Hardware specialization is an increasingly common technique to enable improved performance and energy efficiency in spite of the diminished benefits of technology scaling. Exploring hardware specialization requires a vertically integrated research approach spanning applications, compilers, run-times, instruction set design, microarchitectures, and VLSI implementation. In the first part of the talk, I will describe our work on a new architectural design pattern called explicit loop specialization (XLOOPS) based on the idea of elegantly encoding inter-iteration loop dependence patterns in the instruction set. The XLOOPS hardware/software abstraction requires only lightweight changes to a general-purpose compiler to generate XLOOPS binaries and enables executing these binaries on (1) traditional microarchitectures with minimal performance impact, (2) specialized microarchitectures to improve performance and/or energy efficiency, and (3) adaptive microarchitectures that can seamlessly migrate loops between traditional and specialized execution to dynamically trade off performance versus energy efficiency. Our initial results show promising performance improvements compared to simple in-order processors and energy efficiency improvements compared to complex out-of-order processors. In the second part of the talk, I will describe PyMTL and Pydgin, two new Python-based frameworks designed to improve the productivity of vertically integrated computer architecture research. PyMTL leverages the Python programming language to create a highly productive domain-specific embedded language for concurrent-structural modeling and hardware design. The PyMTL framework encourages a philosophy of ""modeling towards layout"" in which a microarchitecture is incrementally refined from a high-level functional-level model, to a timing-approximate cycle-level model, to a bit-accurate RTL implementation. Pydgin is a framework for rapidly developing very fast instruction-set simulators (ISSs) from a Python-based architecture description language. Both frameworks were critical in exploring the XLOOPS architectural design pattern, and we are continuing to leverage these frameworks in our research and teaching. Bio: Christopher Batten is an assistant professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University, where he leads a research group focusing on energy-efficient parallel computer architecture for both high-performance and embedded applications. His work has been recognized with several awards, including an AFOSR Young Investigator Program award (2015), Intel Early Career Faculty Honor Program award (2013), an NSF CAREER Award (2012), a DARPA Young Faculty Award (2012), and an IEEE Micro Top Picks selection (2004). His teaching has been recognized with a Michael Tien '72 Excellence in Teaching Award (2013) and a James M. and Marsha D.

But information management systems can only be as good as the information they manage. They struggle and often fail to correctly infer meaning from large blobs of text and the mysterious actions and demands of users. And they are useless for managing information that is never captured. Instead of accepting the existing information as an immutable condition, I will argue that there are significant opportunities to help and motivate people to improve the quality and quantity of information their tools manage, and to exploit that better information to benefit its users. The greatest challenge in doing so is developing systems, particularly user interfaces that overcome humans’ perverse reluctance to invest small present-moment effort for large future payoffs. Effective systems must minimize the effort needed to record high-quality information and maximize the perceived future benefits of that information investment. I will support these ideas with examples covering structured data management and presentation, notetaking, collaborative filtering, and social media. Bio: David R. Karger is a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Since earning his PhD at Stanford University in 1994, he has contributed to many areas of computer science, publishing in algorithms, machine learning, information retrieval, personal information management, networking, peer to peer systems, coding theory, and human-computer interaction. A general interest has been to make it easier for people to create, find, organize, manipulate, and share information. He formed and leads the Haystack group to investigate these issues. The group researches tools that get out of the way, flexing and personalizing their representations and interfaces to reflect the needs of their users. Karger is particularly interested in the large gap between the flexible, highly individualistic approaches people take to managing information in the real world and the narrow, rigid, impersonal workflows into which they are forced by existing computer tools."

My research seeks to understand: what does it take for mobile devices—power-constrained as they are –to operate at the speed of human perception? And what new opportunities emerge as a result?  Via a pair of vignettes, I illustrate two such low-latency mobile systems. The first focuses on app streaming, an emerging app execution model in which remote servers execute logic and rendering on behalf of thin clients. App streaming promises any device access to any app at any time. Unfortunately, the reality is that wide-area network latencies often exceed thresholds above which many interactive apps such as games tend to be deemed too slow. In response, I describe Outatime, a speculative execution system for app streaming that masks network latency. In Outatime, the server renders speculative frames of future possible outcomes, delivering them to the client one entire roundtrip early, and recovers quickly from mis-speculations when they occur. Clients perceive little latency. Outatime has been implemented on two high-quality, commercially-released twitch-based games. Users report strongly preferring Outatime to standard streaming, since Outatime delivers real-time interactivity as fast as—and in some cases, even faster than—traditional local client-side execution. In a second example of low-latency interaction, I describe a Kinect-like device tracking system, FAR. Unlike Kinect, FAR is portable, requiring only the phones in our hands. Yet FAR performs continuous, fast and accurate phone-to-phone localization that matches the (often very fast) speed and sensitivity of human movement. In fact, FAR's accuracy is comparable to—and in some cases even superior to—that of Kinect. Lab trials and many real world deployments indicate that FAR can fully support dynamic human motion in real-time. Bio: David Chu is a researcher in Microsoft's Mobility and Networking Research Group.

"Monday, February 22, 2016",10:00 am,2405 Siebel Center,"Dr. Manos Kapritsos: ""Sustainable Reliability for Distributed Systems""","Abstract: Reliability is a first-order concern in modern distributed systems. Even large, well-provisioned systems such as Gmail and Amazon Web Services can be brought down by failures, incurring millions of dollars of cost and hurting company reputation. Such service outages are typically caused by either hardware failures or software bugs. We have developed various techniques for dealing with both kinds of failures (e.g., replication, software testing), but those techniques come at a significant cost. For example, our replication techniques for handling hardware failures are incompatible with multithreaded execution, forcing a stark choice between reliability and performance. As for guarding against software failures, our only real option today is to test our system as best we can and hope we have not missed any subtle bugs. In principle there exists another option, formal verification, that fully addresses this problem, but its overhead in both raw performance and programming effort is considered way too impractical to adopt in real developments.  In this talk, I make the case for Sustainable Reliability, i.e., reliability techniques that provide strong guarantees without imposing unnecessary overhead that limits their practicality. My talk covers the challenges faced by both hardware and software failures and proposes novel techniques in each area. In particular, I will describe how we can reconcile replication and multithreaded execution by rethinking the architecture of replicated systems. The resulting system, Eve, offers an unprecedented combination of strong guarantees and high performance. I will also describe IronFleet, a new methodology that brings formal verification of distributed systems within the realm of practicality. Despite its strong guarantees, IronFleet incurs a very reasonable overhead in both performance and programming effort. Bio: Manos Kapritsos is a postdoctoral researcher at Microsoft Research in Redmond, Washington. He received his PhD from the University of Texas at Austin in 2014.

This talk will discuss two of the most common choices, along with some of their consequences.

Second is the family of layered representations, for instance as used in neural networks, where simple functions may be not only added but also composed. The key result in this second section is that while linear and few-layered representations can approximate any function, in doing so they can require exponentially as many simple functions as a many-layered representation. To close, the talk will cover many avenues for future work.

Despite the importance suggested by many noncoding variants statistically associated with human disease, nearly all such variants have unknown mechanism. Here, we address this challenge using an approach based on a recent machine learning advance—deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We introduce an open source package Basset to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNaseI-seq and demonstrate far greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for GWAS SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell’s chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome.

Despite decades of research, we still lack understanding of the limits of important subclasses of computation such as those relying on algebraic reasoning. Such algorithms are important for solving common problems such as computing Fast Fourier Transforms, solving systems of linear equations and computing matchings in graphs in parallel. The past decade has seen an intense revival of interest in algebraic computation, with a number of stunning results exploiting the underlying mathematical structure and shedding new light on the algebraic analogue of the P versus NP problem (VP versus VNP). An important theme in this study is that many algebraic algorithms, owing to their mathematical structure, use randomness as a non-trivial computational resource. Randomness is a pervasive algorithmic paradigm, but can have associated costs, both in theory and in practice. It is a fundamental question on how to minimize the usage of randomness in algorithms while otherwise retaining efficiency. In fact, foundational results show that efficiently derandomizing algorithms is equivalent to proving lower bounds, and may even show that P is different from NP! In this talk I will discuss my work on the limits of algebraic computation and how to exploit them to develop better algorithms. Along the way, I will highlight connections to coding theory, low-rank tensors, pseudorandom generators, algebraic proof systems, quantum entanglement, and Mulmuley's Geometric Complexity Theory program for proving VP!=VNP.

However, there exist several challenging bottlenecks in the end-to-end process of building and deploying advanced analytics applications. My research focuses on abstractions, algorithms, and systems to mitigate such bottlenecks and accelerate advanced analytics from a data management standpoint. In this talk, I will focus on my work on mitigating one such pervasive bottleneck in the process of feature engineering for ML—joins of multiple tables. Many real-world datasets are multi-table, connected by key-foreign key relationships, but almost all ML toolkits expect single-table inputs. This forces data scientists to join all tables and materialize a single table that collects all features. Alas, such joins often cause the output to blow up in size, which slows down ML, increases costs, and leads to data maintenance headaches. In my work, I show how it is possible to mitigate these issues by ""avoiding joins physically,"" i.e., pushing ML down through joins. This reduces runtime without affecting accuracy. Going further, I apply statistical learning theory to show how it is often possible to also ""avoid joins logically,"" i.e., ignore entire tables outright without losing much accuracy, but achieving significant runtime gains.

Our ability to precisely reason about the security of these systems has been outpaced by their rapid evolution. Provable security is a framework for analyzing the security of cryptographic primitives and distributed algorithms, the components from which these systems are built. My research extends provable security to new settings where it is needed. My focus in this talk will be on cryptocurrencies, decentralized peer-to-peer networks that provide alternatives to (i.e., disrupt!) traditional financial services and exemplify the challenges posed by emergent systems. First, cryptocurrencies do not fit well within existing distributed systems models, since participants are anonymous and driven by incentives. I have therefore developed new models for this setting, enabling me to invent and rigorously validate novel constructions with improved security and efficiency. Second, while cryptocurrencies have promise as a low-barrier-to-entry platform for diverse applications, these applications require sophisticated cryptography—and composing with cryptographic primitives is notoriously difficult and dangerous. My approach is to develop programming language designs that turn cryptographic primitives into safe building blocks for application developers to use.

I will also discuss how the techniques developed in these works have transcended cryptography and found applications in randomness extraction, coding theory, and, complexity theory. I will also briefly talk about my work on applied cryptography and its impact. Bio: Vipul Goyal is a researcher at Microsoft Research, India.

Developers need high-level abstractions that help them reason about and maintain the properties they desire. Getting these abstractions right is important: poor abstractions can lead to bad performance, corrupted data, and security breaches. Language-based techniques can provide better abstractions to programmers that help them build secure and scalable distributed applications. In this talk, I’ll discuss two recent excursions toward this goal: Mobile Fabric and Flow-Limited Authorization. Mobile Fabric is a Java-like language and system for building distributed applications using persistent data and mobile code, similar to the applications on the web today. Unlike current applications, all Mobile Fabric applications enforce the confidentiality and integrity of the data they process, even in the presence of malicious code. Flow-Limited Authorization unifies two fundamental perspectives on security: authorization, which concerns who trusts whom, and information flow control, which concerns who may learn a secret or influence a value. Flow-Limited Authorization combines these perspectives into a single model, strengthening their security guarantees and eliminating potential vulnerabilities.

Participants face such complex decisions in these settings that the classic economic equilibrium is not a good predictor of their behavior. The analysis and design of these systems has to go beyond equilibrium assumptions. Evidence from online auction marketplaces suggests that participants rather use algorithmic learning. In the first part of the talk, I will describe a theoretical framework for the analysis and design of efficient market mechanisms, with robust guarantees that hold under learning behavior, incomplete information and in complex environments with many mechanisms running at the same time. In the second part of the talk, I will describe a method for analyzing datasets from such marketplaces and inferring private parameters of participants under the assumption that their observed behavior is the outcome of a learning algorithm.

The new technology often comes with a rigid and perhaps expensive list of pre-requisites; and it affects the overall cost-effectiveness, deployability, and accessibility of the solution. For example, a user might find it hard to buy and carry a medical device with them every day. The primary theme of my PhD research has been to reduce the adoption and deployment barriers of new sensing technologies by using the sensors that are already around us. In this talk, I will present my research on extending the capabilities of the on-board sensors on consumer devices for various applications. First, I will discuss how we can leverage the on-device sensors to enable novel human-computer interactions and make the mobile devices more usable. Next, I will discuss my work on using the on-device sensors for building health technologies that work as well as their clinically-approved counterparts and they continue to evolve through deployments in various parts of the world. Finally, I will discuss how my recent work in extending the on-device sensors is shaping my future interests and how I plan to continue to lower the adoption barriers for new sensing technologies.

I will present my approach to quantifying privacy, which has been broadly adopted by the research community, as well as a systematic methodology for achieving optimal privacy while preserving data utility. I will then discuss my ongoing research at the junction of privacy, data science, and machine learning in two emerging scenarios: generating privacy-preserving synthetic data and building accurate deep-learning models that respect privacy of the training data.

"Tuesday, April 12, 2016",10:00 am,2405 Siebel Center,"Tuo Zhao: ""Compute Faster and Learn Better: Machine Learning via Nonconvex Model-based Optimization""","Abstract: Nonconvex optimization naturally arises in many machine learning problems (e.g., sparse learning, matrix factorization, and tensor decomposition). Machine learning researchers exploit various nonconvex formulations to gain modeling flexibility, estimation robustness, adaptivity, and computational scalability. Although classical computational complexity theory has shown that solving nonconvex optimization is generally NP-hard in the worst case, practitioners have proposed numerous heuristic optimization algorithms, which achieve outstanding empirical performance in real-world applications. To bridge this gap between practice and theory, we propose a new generation of model-based optimization algorithms and theory, which incorporate statistical thinking into modern optimization. Particularly, when designing practical computational algorithms, we take the underlying statistical models into consideration (e.g., sparsity, low rankness). Our novel algorithms exploit hidden geometric structures behind many nonconvex optimization problems, and they can obtain global optima with the desired statistics properties in polynomial time with high probability.

"Tuesday, April 12, 2016",2:00 pm,B02 CSL,"Dr. Jignesh Patel, ""Towards hardware-software co-design for data processing: A plea and a proposal.""","ABSTRACT: For decades, we the database folks have been playing a catch-up game to the changes made by the hardware folks (aka. architects). In the mid 90s, we realized that the architects added processor caches, so we starting rewriting data processing kernels to make better use of caches. Then, we realized that processors have a Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), misses to which are outrageously expensive. So, we went and fixed our software to make better use of TLBs. In the earlier part of this century, we realized that the processors have made tremendous advances in micro-architecture with features like out-of-order execution, so we started to think about how to react to that. We now find that in some cases we need to throw away changes that we made in reaction to some of the previous architectural events and go back to the drawing board. This game of waiting for architects to give us new hardware features and then us reacting to it, repeated in an endless cycle, is wasteful. This waiting game is especially vexing since architecture is now at a crucial pivot point where radically different architectures are now being proposed (e.g. integrated GPUs, HMC, Smart SSDs, etc.). Can we find a more synergistic and collaborative way of co-charting the future? To help out, from the database side, I have two very simple data processing kernels that I feel are likely to power a large fraction of analytical data processing workloads. Can we use these as a starting point to get the architects to help us figure out where various future architectural design paths are likely to lead, and thus have a more synergistic hardware-software co-design strategy for data?

Scientific disciplines such as biology, astronomy, and physics rely heavily on data science. Businesses use it to better understand their customers and politicians use large-scale data analysis to better target their voters. Some of the most popular analysis tools among data scientists offer declarative interfaces where users simply describe the data they need instead of specifying how to generate it. In order to enable such interfaces, we must solve the NP-hard query optimization problem. The goal of query optimization is to find optimal execution plans for declarative queries. In my talk, I will give an overview of my recent work on query optimization. The specific context of large-scale data science motivates several new problem variants that are particularly hard to solve. I will show how techniques such as approximation, parallelization, and pre-processing make solving those problem under real-time constraints practical. I will quickly cover recent experiments in which I used a D-Wave 2X adiabatic quantum annealer for solving certain query optimization variants. Finally, I will describe a data science research project that I conducted at Google Mountain View. Its goal was to analyze all text posted on the Web to infer, for all entities in a large knowledge base, which subjective properties the average user associates with them.

"Wednesday, April 20, 2016",10:00 am,2405 Siebel Center,"Gennady Pekhimenko: ""Practical Data Compression for Modern Memory Hierarchies""","Abstract: Although compression has been widely used for decades to reduce file sizes (thereby conserving storage capacity and network bandwidth then transferring files), there has been little to no use of compression within modern memory hierarchies. Why not? Especially as programs become increasingly data-intensive, the capacity and bandwidth within the memory hierarchy (including caches, main memory, and their associated interconnects) are becoming increasingly important bottlenecks. If data compression could be applied successfully to the memory hierarchy, it could potentially relieve pressure on these bottlenecks by increasing effective capacity, increasing effective bandwidth, and even reducing energy consumption. In this talk, I describe a new, practical approach to integrating data compression within the memory hierarchy, including on-chip caches, main memory, and both on-chip and off-chip interconnects. This new approach is fast, simple, and effective in saving storage space. A key insight in our approach is that access time (including decompression latency) is critical in modern memory hierarchies. By combining inexpensive hardware support with modest OS support, our holistic approach to compression achieves substantial improvements in performance and energy efficiency across the memory hierarchy. In addition to exploring compression-related issues and enabling practical solutions in modern CPU systems, we discover new problems in realizing hardware-based compression for GPU-based systems and develop new solutions to solve these problems.

This is due to the combined effect of breakdowns in transistor scaling, causing severe chip-level power limitations, and monolithic and inefficient general purpose microarchitecture. In this work, I propose and evaluate a concept called “behavioral specialization,” where the design of general purpose processors is modularized by adding programmable offload engines, each best-suited for different program behaviors or characteristics. To explore this principle, I designed a modular general-purpose core which transparently improves performance and energy efficiency by integer factors. I also extend these principles to create an architecture for highly-regular and parallelizable workloads for a further order of magnitude improvements. I have discovered that a small number of exploitable program behaviors can cover a majority of applications, that dataflow architectures become practical and useful in hybrid execution with a general purpose core, and that programmable architectures can be competitive with domain specific alternatives on well-behaved workloads, with only small area and energy overheads. Overall, behavioral specialization causes disruptive change in microprocessor tradeoffs, enabling mobile-class processor energy-efficiency with desktop-class performance.

Designing for Understandability: The Raft Consensus Algorithm   Abstract: Consensus algorithms are the most important algorithms in distributed systems; they allow a collection of machines to work as a coherent group that can provide continuous service even if some of its members fail. Paxos has dominated the discussion of consensus algorithms for the last 25 years, but it is quite difficult to understand and its specification is not complete enough to provide a good foundation for practical implementations. In this talk, I will describe a new consensus algorithm called Raft. Raft is unusual in that we designed it with understandability as the most important goal. This goal led to a different decomposition of the consensus problem that is more intuitive than Paxos and which also provides a better foundation for practical implementations. A user study confirmed that Raft is indeed easier to understand than Paxos.      "

This is especially true in applications such as robotics, in which even a small error rate in the perception system can have catastrophic consequences for the overall system. This talk will review a few ideas that could be used to start formalizing the research issues involved in developing robust vision systems. These include a systematic approach to the problem of self-assessment of vision algorithms and predicting quality metrics on the inputs to the vision algorithms, ideas on how to manage multiple hypotheses generated from a vision algorithm rather than relying on a single ""hard"" decision, learning perception from few examples and from unsupervised data, and transfer learning for rapid adaptation to new environments and tasks. These ideas will be illustrated with examples of recent vision for scene understanding, depth estimation, and object recognition, and with applications to autonomous air and ground robots. Bio: Martial Hebert is a Professor of Robotics Carnegie Mellon University and Director of the Robotics Institute, which he joined in 1984. His interests include computer vision, especially recognition in images and video data, model building and object recognition from 3D data, and perception for autonomous robots.

However, many collections contain an additional type of data: how people use the documents. For example, readers click on articles in a newspaper website, scientists place articles in their personal libraries, and lawmakers vote on a collection of bills. Behavior data is essential both for making predictions about users (such as for a recommendation system) and for understanding how a collection and its users are organized. I will review the basics of topic modeling and describe our recent research on collaborative topic models—models that simultaneously analyze a collection of texts and its corresponding user behavior. We studied collaborative topic models on 80,000 scientists' libraries from Mendeley and 100,000 users' click data from the arXiv. Collaborative topic models enable interpretable recommendation systems, capturing scientists' preferences and pointing them to articles of interest. Further, these models can organize the articles according to the discovered patterns of readership. For example, we can identify articles that are important within a field and articles that transcend disciplinary boundaries. BIO: David Blei is a Professor of Statistics and Computer Science at Columbia University, and a member of the Columbia Data Science Institute. His research is in statistical machine learning, involving probabilistic topic models, Bayesian nonparametric methods, and approximate posterior inference algorithms for massive data.

"Monday, October 03, 2016",4:00 pm,2405 Siebel Center,"Dr. David Garlan: ""Self-Adaptive Systems""","Abstract: The increasing use of computing systems in every facet of our everyday lives raises a number of challenges for software engineering. In particular, one of the most important requirements for today’s systems is high availability – even in the presence of faults, changing environmental conditions, and attacks. To address these requirements we need to be able to build systems that take more control over their own dependability, security, and usefulness – automating many of the tasks that now lead to system failures and that require computing experts and administrators to manage. This has led to a new sub-field of software engineering and systems design, sometimes termed Autonomic Computing, Self-healing Systems, or Self-Adaptive Systems. In this talk I describe this emerging field and recent advances that allow us to address various engineering challenges, including (a) the ability to support self-healing through architectural models and automated repair, (b) new techniques for diagnosing faults at run-time with applications to manufacturing control systems, (c) the ability to support self-securing systems, and (d) the ability to reason about human-in-the loop systems. Bio: David Garlan is a Professor of Computer Science in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where he has been on the faculty since 1990.

"Monday, November 07, 2016",4:00 pm,2405 Siebel Center,Dr. Daniel Jackson,"Abstract: Engineers make things work reliably and efficiently; designers make them useful. In the development of buildings, for example, the civil engineer is concerned about the internal structural that prevents the building from falling down; the designer (i.e. the architect) is concerned about the aspects of the building (light, space, etc.) experienced by its users. We have a pretty good theory of software engineering that guides the internal structure of software systems, using notions such as decoupling, information hiding, representation independence, redundancy, and so on. But we don’t have much of a theory to guide the design of software: the aspects that determine the user’s experience. In this talk, I’ll present the elements of an evolving theory of software design based on the identification of concepts and purposes, and I’ll present how some straightforward design rules that can help improve the design of a software system without resorting to trial and error (e.g., by brainstorming and user testing). I’ll give examples from a variety of well-known applications. I’ll also tell you about a new project in which we’re developing a mechanism for synthesizing applications from concepts drawn from a library of clichés.

"Wednesday, November 30, 2016",11:00 am,2405 Siebel Center,"Dr. Mark Hill: ""Efficient Memory Virtualization: Can we have higher dimensionality at the cost of none?""","Abstract: Two important trends in computing are evident. First, computing will become more data centric, where low-latency access to a very large amount of data is critical. Second, virtual machines will play a critical role in enabling server consolidation, security, and fault tolerance as substantial computing migrates to shared resources in cloud-like services. Since the software stack accesses data using virtual addresses, fast address translation is a prerequisite for efficient data-centric computation and for providing the benefits of virtualization to a wide range of applications. I will show that the overheads of virtual memory are mostly associated with long latency page walks which can be 1D (native) or 2D (virtualized). I address the above challenge in a comprehensive manner that allows fast address translation in both the virtualized and native system for wide variety of workloads. I aim to achieve near-zero overheads of virtual memory through various mechanisms that reduces the dimensionality of page walks while retaining benefits of paging.  In this talk, I will cover two mechanisms that drastically reduce overheads of address translation. First, I will describe a hardware software co-design called Redundant Memory Mappings (RMM) which uses a new compact representation called range translations redundantly with paging to improve performance of native systems. A range translation is defined as a mapping between contiguous virtual pages mapped to contiguous physical pages of arbitrary size with uniform protection bits. Second, I will describe a new virtualized page walk called agile paging, which combines both state-of-the-art techniques to virtualize memory---nested paging and shadow paging---and exceeds the best of both techniques while improving performance of virtual machines.

However, if one is only interested in small parts of the output at any given time, is it really necessary to solve the entire computational problem? Is it even necessary to view the whole input? We survey recent work in the model of local computation algorithms which for a given input, supports queries by a user to values of specified bits of a legal output. The goal is to design local computation algorithms in such a way that very little of the input needs to be seen in order to determine the value of any single bit of the output. In this talk, we describe results on a variety of problems for which sublinear time and space local computation algorithms have been developed — we will give special focus to finding maximal independent sets and sparse spanning graphs. bio:Ronitt Rubinfeld joined the MIT faculty in 2004, and is on the faculty at the University of Tel Aviv.

This is the prototypical question in robust statistics, a field that took shape in the 1960's with the pioneering works of Tukey and Huber. Unfortunately, all known robust estimators are hard to compute in high dimensions. This prompts the following question: Can we reconcile robustness and computational efficiency in high-dimensional learning? We give the first efficient algorithms for robustly learning a high-dimensional Gaussian that are able to tolerate a constant fraction of corruptions. Our techniques also yield robust estimators for several other high-dimensional models, including Bayesian networks, and various mixture models.

Unfortunately, existing approaches for collecting this information rely on heavily modifying the software and/of hardware of the program and/or system we are trying to observe. Worse, such monitoring suffers from Observer's Effect, i.e. the modifications introduced to enable observation change the behavior of the system we are trying to observe. This is especially problematic when the purpose of observation is to gather fine-grain timing information, or in systems whose behavior adapts to meet real-time demands. In this talk, I will describe our work on using electromagnetic emanations from the monitored system to obtain fine-grain information about program execution, without any modification to the observed system or its software, and thus without the Observer's Effect. As two examples of this approach, I will present ZOP (Zero Overhead Profiling), our technique for recovering the control flow path taken by the program, along with the actual timing of control flow events, and Spectral Profiling, our low-cost technique for profiling and verification of loop execution. Finally, I will discuss our ongoing work on using EM spectra for anomaly detection, specifically in the context of detecting malware activity.

To meet such demand, parallel and distributed processing are ubiquitously applied with increasing computing resources consisting of many-core CPUs, more scalable and cost-effective memory and storage, and other technologies. Distributed and parallel data processing incurs significant data movement between machines and across the memory hierarchy in the same machine. This data movement not only affects performance but also consumes significant energy. A recent study showed that data movement between CPUs and off-chip memory consumes two orders of magnitude more energy than a floating point operation. In this talk, I will introduce our vertically integrated approach to reduce data movement in graph processing applications in various scales, from distributed systems to emerging technology. First, I will present a novel 3D graph partitioning for distributed graph processing that leads to significant reduction of data communication as well as performance improvements. Second, I will present an expressive programming model designed for semi-external single machine graph processing systems that enables the beyond neighborhood and other constraints. Our system provides up to tens or even thousands of times speedup compared to the state-of-the-art system. Third, I will discuss the acceleration of graph processing at an architecture level with ReRAM, an emerging memory technology with in-situ computation.

Prominent examples of digital market mechanisms include auctions for ads (run by companies such as Google) and electromagnetic spectrum (used by the US government). I will discuss several recent developments in fair division and mechanism design. I will start with a dictatorship theorem for fair division (cake cutting), showing that requiring truthfulness gives rise to a dictator. Next, I will turn to the paradigmatic model of multi-unit markets, where I will show that truthfulness requires discarding resources, and that this problem is alleviated when the market is even mildly competitive.

These sounds reveal physical properites of the objects, as well as the force and motion of the physical interaction. We've explored a toy version of that learning-through-interaction by recording audio and video while we hit many things with a drumstick. We developed an algorithm that predicts sounds from silent videos of the drumstick interactions. The algorithm uses a recurrent neural network to predict sound features from videos, and then produces a waveform from these features with an example-based synthesis procedure. We demonstrate that the sounds generated by our model are realistic enough to fool participants in a ""real or fake"" psychophysical experiment, and that the task of predicting sounds allows our system to learn about material properties in the scene.

Two critical challenges in this domain are of developing algorithms for robust learning and designing incentive mechanisms for eliciting high-quality data. In this talk, I describe progress on these challenges in the context of two canonical settings, namely those of ranking and classification. In addressing the first challenge, I introduce a class of ""permutation-based"" models that are considerably richer than classical models, and present algorithms for estimation that are both rate-optimal and significantly more robust than prior state-of-the-art methods. I also discuss how these estimators automatically adapt and are simultaneously rate-optimal over the classical models, thereby enjoying a surprising a win-win in the bias-variance tradeoff. As for the second challenge, I present a class of ""multiplicative"" incentive mechanisms, and show that they are the unique mechanisms that can guarantee honest responses. Extensive experiments on a popular crowdsourcing platform reveal that the theoretical guarantees of robustness and efficiency indeed translate to practice, yielding several-fold improvements over prior art.

Looking into the future, we expect to build machine learning systems that use RL to turn predictions into actions; applications include robotics, dialog systems, online education, adaptive medical treatment, to name but a few. In this talk, I show how theoretical insights from supervised learning can help understand RL, and better appreciate the unique challenges that arise from multi-stage decision-making. The first part of the talk focuses on an interesting phenomenon, that a short planning horizon can produce better policies when there is limited data. I explain it by making a formal analogy to empirical risk minimization, and I argue that a short planning horizon helps avoid overfitting. The second part of the talk concerns a core algorithmic challenge in state-of-the-art RL: sample-efficient exploration in large state spaces.

Based on advances of ML, new systems and models are being deployed in every domain imaginable, leading to rapid and widespread deployment of software based inference and decision-making. Traditional ML systems, however, make stationarity assumption on the training and testing data distributions, and do not consider active adversaries manipulating either distribution. Recent work demonstrated that motivated adversaries could circumvent anomaly detection or classification models at testing time through evasion attacks, or can inject well-crafted malicious points into the training data to induce errors in classification through poisoning attacks. In addition, by undermining the integrity of learning systems, the privacy of users' data can also be compromised. Few solutions against these risks have been proposed, but they are not resilient against sophisticated adversaries responding dynamically to the deployed defenses. Thus, the question of how to improve the robustness of ML models in adversarial environments remains largely unanswered. In this talk, I will focus on examining and answering theoretical questions about the limits of classifier evasion (evasion attack), adversarial contamination (poisoning attack) and privacy preserving problem in adversarial environments, as well as introducing how to design practical resilient learning algorithms for a wide range of applications, including spam filters, malware detection systems, recommendation systems, etc. Using game theoretic techniques, I modeled the interactions between an intelligent adversary and a machine learning system as Stackelberg game to search for robust learning strategies with respect to the adversary’s optimal responses. I also tailored my approaches to build scalable robust machine learning systems to meet the demand of big data applications.

Hypotheses can be rapidly generated and evaluated in situ, facilitating an accretive construction of knowledge and serendipitous discovery. Yet, existing models of visualization relegate interaction to a second-class citizen: imperative event handling callbacks that are difficult to specify, and even harder to reason about. In this talk, I will introduce two new declarative languages that lower the threshold for authoring interactive visualizations and that enable higher-level reasoning about the design space of interactions. Reactive Vega is an expressive representation that is well-suited for custom, explanatory visualizations. It shifts the burden of execution from the user to the underlying streaming dataflow system.

In supporting these activities, robots need to engage with humans in socially cooperative interactions in which they work together toward a common goal in a socially intuitive manner. Such interactions require robots to coordinate actions, predict task intent, direct attention, and convey relevant information to human partners. In this talk, I will present how techniques in human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, and robotics can be applied in a principled manner to create and study socially cooperative interactions between humans and robots. I will demonstrate social, cognitive, and task benefits of effective human-robot teams in various application contexts.

The failure of our existing security infrastructure motivates the need for improved technologies, and cryptography provides a powerful tool for doing this. There is a misperception that the cryptography we use today is a ""solved problem"" and the real security weaknesses are in software or other areas of the system. This is, in fact, not true at all, and over the past several years we have seen a number of serious vulnerabilities in the cryptographic pieces of systems, some with large consequences. In this talk, I will discuss two aspects of securing deployed cryptographic systems. I will first talk about the evaluation of systems in the wild, using the example of how to efficiently and effectively recover user passwords submitted over TLS encrypted with RC4, with applications to many methods of web authentication as well as the popular IMAP protocol for email. I will then address my work on developing tools to design and create cryptographic systems and which bridges the often large gap between theory and practice with the introduction of AutoGroup+, a tool that automatically translates cryptographic schemes from the mathematical setting used in the literature to that typically used in practice, giving both a secure and optimal output.

The Wide-Area Network (WAN) latency that separates datacenters is orders of magnitude larger than traditional network latency within a datacenter. This makes it expensive to preserve the consistency of data copies. However, consistency and high-level access abstractions like database transactions are favored by developers because they hide the complexity of the underlying replica and concurrency control. This has led to the adoption of consistent transactions in large-scale geo-replicated systems. In this talk, I will present the fundamental challenges in designing geo-replicated data management systems. Specifically, transaction latency is high due to the need to coordinate between datacenters spread across the world. Traditionally, coordination is performed by polling other datacenters for permissions to execute. This made a Round-Trip Time (RTT) latency inevitable. In geo-replication, this is an expensive cost and thus leads to the question: Is it possible to avoid the polling paradigm of coordination? Message Futures is a protocol that demonstrates a new paradigm of continuous, proactive coordination. In this paradigm, transactions can coordinate in sub-RTT latency. Breaking the RTT latency barrier frames the next part of the talk, where I derive a lower bound for coordination latency. The proposed lower-bound model inspires a design of a coordination protocol, called Helios, which targets achieving the lower-bound latency. The talk will also discuss many of the practical aspects of building scalable large-scale data management and communication platforms for geo-replicated systems. I conclude the talk with future opportunities for global-scale data management in the context of edge computing, Internet of Things, and data science.

In this talk, I will present some of my work in addressing such challenges. This first part of the talk focuses on learning semantic representations for text data. Recent advances in natural language processing build upon the approach of embedding words as low dimensional vectors. The fundamental observation that empirically justifies this approach is that these vectors can capture semantic relations. A probabilistic model for generating text is proposed to mathematically explain this observation and existing popular embedding algorithms. It also reveals surprising connections to classical notions such as Pointwise Mutual Information, and allows the design of novel, simple, and practical algorithms for applications such as sentence embedding.

A novel notion of bisimulation, which we call cut-bisimulation, allows the two programs to semantically synchronize at relevant ""cut"" points, but to evolve independently otherwise. Using the K semantic framework, we have implemented the first language-independent tool for proving program equivalence, parametric in the formal semantics of the two languages. To demonstrate the practicality of our general approach, we have prototyped a translation validation system for the instruction selection phase of the LLVM compiler infrastructure, a widely used commercial-quality system comprising over 140,000 lines of C++, for the case of compiling to x86-64. Our experience shows that we are able to prove correctness of translations between two fundamentally different languages, while requiring fewer than 500 added lines of code to generate compiler hints; the added code is conceptually simple and requires no formal methods expertise."

It brings us a promising future of genomic diagnosis and personalized treatment of human disease. The power of NGS is reflected in its ability to measure almost any molecular signal of interest using the following paradigm: 1) signal embedding; 2) sequencing; 3) signal extraction. This talk introduces two of my works on extracting signal from big sequencing data. The first work addresses the problem of accurately estimating transcript abundance from RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) data. Transcript abundance is the relative measure of transcript copy number in cells. It is a fundamental quantity in biology and has a huge impact on human health: studies have shown that transcript abundances are often altered in disease conditions. To extract abundance “signal” from RNA-Seq data, we developed RSEM, one of the most accurate transcript abundance estimation tools, by utilizing modern statistical learning techniques. RSEM has been extensively used around the world since its release: RSEM papers are cited over 2,300 times and RSEM is used in nationwide consortium projects such as TCGA and ENCODE. The second work introduces PROBer, a statistical learning software for accurate epitranscriptomic mark detection. Epitranscriptomics, also known as RNA epigenetics, is a new field focusing on the study of RNA structure, RNA modification and RNA-protein interaction at the transcriptome scale. These three aspects are ladders to understanding the mechanism of alternative splicing, of which the disturbance often results in severe diseases. Epitranscriptomic sequencing data often contain background noise and ambiguous position information, which jointly influence the detection accuracy of epitranscriptomic marks. Therefore, we need to simultaneously solve the problems of signal separation and ambiguity resolving. Existing analyzing methods heavily rely on ad hoc heuristics, which could not handle these two problems well. PROBer incorporates both background noise and position information into its generative probabilistic model, and learns them from data automatically. We compare PROBer with the existing methods on detecting epitranscriptomic marks. Results on both simulated and real data show that PROBer outperforms them all. In recent years, epitranscriptomics has become a hot research topic. Nature Methods recently selected epitranscriptome analysis as the method of the year. In addition, two newly approved grants from NIH indicate a big funding source in the future. In the last part of my talk, I will discuss how my future research would fit in this emerging trend of epitranscriptomics study.

Despite the wide adoption of fault-tolerance and recovery techniques, these large-scale software systems still fail to effectively deal with configuration errors. In fact, even tolerance/recovery mechanisms are often misconfigured and thus crippled in reality.

I will start with work that seeks for understanding the fundamental causes of misconfigurations. I will then focus on two of my approaches, PCheck and Spex, which enable software systems to anticipate and defend against configuration errors.

The performance of essentially all machine learning applications is limited by bottlenecks with effects that cut across traditional layers in the software stack. Because of this, addressing these bottlenecks effectively requires a broad combination of work in theory, algorithms, systems, and hardware. To do this in a principled way, I propose a general approach called mindful relaxation. The approach starts by finding a way to eliminate a bottleneck by changing the algorithm's semantics. It proceeds by identifying structural conditions that let us prove guarantees that the altered algorithm will still work. Finally, it applies this structural knowledge to implement improvements to the performance and accuracy of entire systems. In this talk, I will describe the mindful relaxation approach, and demonstrate how it can be applied to a specific bottleneck (parallel overheads), problem (inference), and algorithm (asynchronous Gibbs sampling). I will demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on a range of problems including CNNs, and finish with a discussion of my future work on methods for fast machine learning.

Sensors, actuators, and processors are being integrated into globally accessible information networks. These trends are promoting a profusion of networked robotic platforms with distinct features and unique capabilities. As we aspire to harness this diverse array of robots to solve increasingly complex problems, heterogeneity and diversity become design features. However, we still lack a fundamental understanding of how to compose and control large-scale systems of heterogeneous robots. Moreover, as we program diverse robots to exploit their technical complementarities, we create interdependencies and critical links. Such collaborative algorithms give rise to new sources of internal and external threats that lead to unintended failure modes. As a consequence, we need new mechanisms that ensure resilience. I begin my talk by formalizing diversity in the context of dynamic task allocation for large-scale heterogeneous multi-robot systems. In light of this setting, I show how optimal control policies are impacted by the heterogeneity of the robot team. In the second part of the talk, my focus shifts to the question of how to provide resilience to internal failures through precautionary collaboration mechanisms. By building on foundational concepts of network science and security, I show how we can achieve resilience, allowing robot teams to function in the presence of defective and/or malicious robots. Finally, I consider the importance of providing system-wide protection against external threats, and introduce some new ideas that touch upon privacy.

In the final stages of cancer progression, cancerous cells from the primary tumor migrate and seed metastases at distant anatomical sites. The cell division and mutation history of an individual tumor can be represented by a phylogenetic tree, helping guide patient-specific treatments. In this talk, I will introduce combinatorial algorithms for constructing tumor phylogenies from bulk sequencing data, where the measurements are a mixture of thousands of cells. These algorithms are based on a combinatorial characterization of phylogenetic trees as a restricted class of spanning trees in a graph, a characterization that also demonstrates the computational complexity of the problem. In addition, I will introduce a novel theoretical framework for analyzing the history of migrations of cells between anatomical sites in metastatic cancers. Using these methods, I analyze several cancers and identify tumor phylogenies and migration histories that are more biologically plausible than previously reported analyses. Bio: Mohammed El-Kebir is a postdoctoral research associate in the group of Ben Raphael at Princeton University. Mohammed received his PhD in Computer Science at CWI and VU University Amsterdam under the direction of Gunnar Klau and Jaap Heringa. He received the BioSB Young Investigator Award for his PhD thesis. In his research, he leverages a wide range of combinatorial optimization techniques to various questions in biology. Mohammed's current research focuses on tumor phylogenetics, where he develops algorithms for studying the progression of tumors."

"Thursday, March 30, 2017",10:00 am,2405 Siebel Center,"Oliver Kroemer: ""Learning Robot Manipulation Skills through Experience and Generalization""","Abstract: In the future, robots could be used to take care of the elderly, perform household chores, and assist in hazardous situations. However, such applications require robots to manipulate objects in unstructured and everyday environments. Hence, in order to perform a wide range of tasks, robots will need to learn manipulation skills that generalize between different scenarios and objects. In this talk, Oliver Kroemer will present methods that he has developed for robots to learn versatile manipulation skills. The first part of the presentation will focus on learning manipulation skills through trial and error using task-specific reward functions. The presented methods are used to learn the desired trajectories and goal states of individual skills, as well as high-level policies for sequencing skills. The resulting skill sequences reflect the multi-modal structure of the manipulation tasks. The second part of the talk will focus on representations for generalizing skills between different scenarios. He will explain how robots can learn to adapt skills to the geometric features of the objects being manipulated, and he will also discuss how the relevance of these features can be predicted from previously learned skills. The talk will be concluded by discussing open challenges and future research directions for learning manipulation skills. Bio: Oliver Kroemer is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southern California (USC), working together with Gaurav S. Sukhatme in the Robotic Embedded Systems Lab (RESL). His research interests are in machine learning and robotics, with a focus on learning grasping and manipulation skills. He received his Masters and Bachelors degrees in engineering from the University of Cambridge in 2008. He was a Ph.D. student at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems from 2009 to 2011. In 2014, Oliver defended his Ph.D. thesis at the Technische Universitaet Darmstadt. He was a finalist for the 2015 Georges Giralt Ph.D. Award for the best robotics Ph.D. thesis in Europe. In 2015, he first worked as a postdoctoral researcher at TU Darmstadt before starting his current position at USC."

However, little is known about the hundreds of antibiotics produced by microorganisms in the gut, despite the fact that humans are chronically exposed to them. Deep exploration of this meta-antibiome critically depends on a transition from the current one-off process of antibiotics analysis to a high-throughput antibiotics sequencing. I will explain why antibiotics sequencing is relevant to the classical turnpike and beltway problems in computer science and will discuss recent advances in computational antibiotics discovery that span bioinformatics techniques ranging from genome/metagenome sequencing to genome mining to peptidogenomics.

"Thursday, April 06, 2017",4:00 pm,2405 Siebel Center,"David Wentzlaff ""Processors for the Data Center and Cloud of the Future""","Abstract: Current-day data centers and IaaS clouds (e.g. Amazon EC2, MS Azure, Google GCE) use microprocessors that are very similar to or the same as those used in small servers and desktops. This work rethinks the design of microprocessors specifically for data center use along with how microprocessors are affected by the novel economic models that have been popularized by IaaS clouds. This talk will describe several architectural changes including how a processor can be decomposed into sub-components (e.g. ALU, Cache, Fetch Unit) that can be individually rented in IaaS clouds, how running similar programs can be taken advantage of in the data center, how architectural features such as the flavor of memory bandwidth (bursty vs. bulk) can be provisioned and sold in the data center, and novel memory architectures that enable the creation of sub-coherence domains of cache coherence across the data center. This work has not only been simulated, but many of the discussed ideas have been implemented in one of the largest academic processors ever built, the Princeton Piton Processor. Piton is a 25-core manycore built in IBM's 32nm process technology containing over 460 Million transistors and runs full stack Debian Linux with networking. This talk will discuss Piton along with what it takes to tape-out a complex microprocessor in an academic setting. Last, Piton has been recently open sourced as the OpenPiton (http://www.openpiton.org) project which is an expandable manycore platform which includes RTL, thousands of tests, and implementation scripts. The talk will conclude by discussing how OpenPiton is able to contribute to the burgeoning field of open source hardware. Bio: David Wentzlaff is an Assistant Professor at Princeton University in the Electrical Engineering Department. Before joining Princeton, he completed his PhD and MS at MIT and was Lead Architect and Founder of Tilera Corporation, a multicore chip manufacturer now owned by Mellanox.

"Wednesday, August 02, 2017",4:00 pm,4405 Siebel,Professor Todd Austin  (Peering into the Post Moore's Law World),"Abstract For decades, Moore's Law dimensional scaling has been the fuel that propelled the computing industry forward, by delivering performance, power and cost advantages with each new generation of silicon. Today, these scaling benefits are slowing to a crawl. If the computing industry wants to continue to make scalability the primary source of value in tomorrow's computing systems, we will have to quickly find new and productive ways to scale future systems. In this talk, I will highlight my work and the work of others that is rejuvenating scaling through the application of heterogeneous parallel designs. Leveraging these technologies to solve the scaling problem will be a significant challenge, as future scalability success will ultimately be less about ""how"" to do it and more about ""how much"" will it cost.   Bio Todd Austin is a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. His research interests include computer architecture, robust and secure system design, hardware and software verification, and performance analysis tools and techniques. Currently Todd is director of C-FAR, the Center for Future Architectures Research, a multi-university SRC/DARPA funded center that is seeking technologies to scale the performance and efficiency of future computing systems. Prior to joining academia, Todd was a Senior Computer Architect in Intel's Microcomputer Research Labs, a product-oriented research laboratory in Hillsboro, Oregon. Todd is the first to take credit (but the last to accept blame) for creating the SimpleScalar Tool Set, a popular collection of computer architecture performance analysis tools. Todd is co-author (with Andrew Tanenbaum) of the undergraduate computer architecture textbook, ""Structured Computer Architecture, 6th Ed."" In addition to his work in academia, Todd is founder and President of SimpleScalar LLC and co-founder of InTempo Design LLC. In 2002, Todd was a Sloan Research Fellow, and in 2007 he received the ACM Maurice Wilkes Award for ""innovative contributions in Computer Architecture including the SimpleScalar Toolkit and the DIVA and Razor architectures."" Todd received his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin in 1996."

We present a class of multithreaded resource-oblivious algorithms for which we establish low cache miss and false sharing overhead on multicores with a wide range of machine parameters, as long as the run-time scheduler is efficient in terms of the number of parallel tasks it schedules across the caches. This class includes efficient algorithms with high levels of parallelism for matrix multiplication, FFT, sorting, list ranking, graph connectivity, sequence alignment and other basic problems.   Bio: Vijaya Ramachandran is Professor of Computer Science at University of Texas at Austin. She received a Ph.D. in EECS from Princeton University. Her research interests are in algorithm design and analysis, and in parallel computation. She has served on the Editorial Boards of several journals in theoretical computer science, including Journal of the ACM, SIAM Journal on Computing, SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, and ACM Transactions on Algorithms. She currently serves on the Editorial Board of ACM Transactions on Parallel Computing."

In this talk, I will describe a brain mapping approach that combine magnetoencephalography (MEG), functional MRI (fMRI) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to yield a spatially and temporally integrated characterization of neural representations during visual perception and memorization. Determining the duration and sequencing of cognitive processes at the scale of the whole human brain provides insights to evaluate the computational strategies that may work best for performing specific tasks.

"Monday, September 25, 2017",4:00 pm,2405 Siebel Center,"Ben Raphael: ""Computational Problems in Cancer Genomics""","Abstract: Cancer is an evolutionary process driven by somatic mutations that accumulate in a population of cells that form a tumor. In the past few years, high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have enabled the measurement of these mutations across thousands of individual tumors. Despite this wealth of data, our understanding of the cancer mutational landscape remains incomplete. In this talk, I will describe algorithms to identify networks of interacting mutations across cancer patients and to infer the evolution of mutations within a tumor from a single patient. Together these approaches help address key analytical challenges in translating measurements of somatic mutations into deeper insights about the processes that drive cancer development.

He will present on Friday, September 29 at 11 am in the NCSA auditorium. Please join us for a brief reception at 10:30 am in the atrium followed by the colloquium in the auditorium. Title: Research and Education using STEM based approaches for modeling, analysis and simulation of biological, bio-inspired and engineering systems Abstract: In the last decade, there have been dramatic advances in our understanding to model, analyze and simulate fundamental mechanisms underlying biological, bio-inspired and engineering systems. Some examples of multidisciplinary applications that arise in such areas include understanding why aneurysms rupture, how zika spreads, modeling micro-air vehicles, studying social dynamics to creating practical solutions to stop poaching of elephants in Africa. Coupled with this research agenda is also a greater need to engage the next generation STEM workforce in such real-world problem solving. In this talk, participants will learn about STEM based research and educational frameworks that not only helps to enhance pedagogical practices of educators but also provides opportunities for students at all levels to engage in multidisciplinary problem solving. Bio: Dr. Padhu Seshaiyer is a tenured Professor of Mathematical Sciences at George Mason University and serves as the Director of the STEM Accelerator Program in the College of Science as well as the Director of COMPLETE (Center for Outreach in Mathematics Professional Learning and Educational Technology) at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. His research interests are in the broad areas of computational mathematics, scientific computing, computational biomechanics and STEM education. During the last decade, Dr. Seshaiyer initiated and directed a variety of educational programs including graduate and undergraduate research, K-12 outreach, teacher professional development, and enrichment programs to foster the interest of students and teachers in STEM at all levels. His research includes the development of new analytical techniques and efficient computational algorithms to obtain numerical solutions to differential equations describing multi-physics interactions. His research in Computational biomechanics includes developing, extending and applying mathematics for the purposes of better understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of the human vascular system. Integrated with the research plan is an education plan where the primary goal is to teach students and teachers at all levels to apply well-developed research concepts, to fundamental applications arising in STEM disciplines."

"Monday, October 09, 2017",4:00 pm,2405 Siebel Center,Eva Tardos: Learning with Low Approximate Regret with Partial Feedback,"Abstract: We consider the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem with partial feedback, minimizing a non-negative loss function using the graph based feedback framework introduced by Mannor and Shamir in 2011. We offer algorithms that attain small loss bounds, as well as low approximate regret against a shifting comparator. Classical learning algorithms add a low level of uniform noise to the algorithm’s choice to limit the variance of the loss estimator used in importance sampling, which also helps the algorithm to shift to a new arm fast enough when the comparator changes. However, such an approach poses significant hurdles to proving small-loss or low approximate regret bounds. We show that a different general technique of freezing arms, rather than adding random noise, does much better in this setting. The idea of freezing arms was proposed by Allenberg et al. in 2006 in the context of bandit learning with multiplicative weights. We show the broad applicability of this technique by extending it to partial information feedback (via a novel dual freezing thresholding technique), and to shifting comparators.

Our goal is to develop an integrated approach to solving very large problems that are hopelessly intractable to solve optimally. We make a number of approximations during planning, including serializing subtasks, factoring distributions, and determinizing stochastic dynamics, but regain robustness and effectiveness through a continuous state-estimation and replanning process. I will describe our application of these ideas to an end-to-end mobile manipulation system, as well as ideas for current and future work on improving correctness and efficiency through learning.

Anecdotes and lessons learned as a student, professor, entrepreneur, and industry leader will be interspersed with some of his technical work in the areas of robotics and virtual reality. The talk will conclude with some thoughts about where industry, research, and education in virtual and augmented reality are heading, or at least ought to be heading.   Bio: Steven M. LaValle is one of the preeminent figures in robotics research, not only revolutionizing motion planning, but also blazing new trails in minimal sensing and virtual reality (VR).   LaValle’s groundbreaking contribution to motion planning, a basic operation in almost all robotics, is the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), which is included in top robotics libraries for use in autonomous vehicles, manufacturing, and humanoid robots. RRTs are also used for protein folding, drug design, automated video game characters, virtual prototyping, architecture, and digital acting.   LaValle has created novel solutions to common problems such as navigation, pursuit-evasion, target tracking, and surveillance, but with cheaper and simpler components than previously necessary. This work in minimal sensing was attractive to Oculus VR.   At Oculus VR, LaValle led the company’s research and development efforts. He holds a patent on perception-based tracking, crucial for reducing the Oculus Rift’s perceived tracking latency. A second patent covers sensor calibration and filtering methods, critical for accuracy and low-latency. Since returning to Illinois, he introduced CS498 ""Virtual Reality,"" bringing his industry knowledge to the classroom. "

"Monday, October 30, 2017",4:00 pm,2405 Siebel Center,Andreas Zeller: Mining Input Grammars for Massive Security Testing,"Knowing which part of a program processes which parts of an input can reveal the structure of the input as well as the structure of the program. In a URL ""http://www.example.com/path/"", for instance, the protocol “http"", the host “www.example.com"", and the path “path"" would be handled by different functions and stored in different variables. Given a set of sample inputs, we use _dynamic tainting_ to trace the data flow of each input character, and aggregate those input fragments that would be handled by the same function into lexical and syntactical entities. The result is a _context-free grammar_ that accurately reflects valid input structure; as it draws on function and variable names, it can be as readable as textbook examples:     URL ::= PROTOCOL ""://"" HOST ""/"" PATH   PROTOCOL ::= “http” | “https” | …   HOST ::= /[a-zA-Z0-9.]+/   ...   We expect inferred grammars to considerably ease the understanding of file and input formats. Their most important use, however, will be in automatic fuzz testing, where grammars can easily be turned into producers that help to quickly cover program features.

Appel: Verifiable C, a logic and tool for deductive verification of the correctness of C programs","Abstract: What do we need in a practical program logic and tool for verifying C programs? It must support pointer data structures with sharing and mutation: separation logic is useful. It should facilitate the use of function pointers in such usage patterns as “objects” or “closures”: it should be higher-order. It should support data abstraction, especially in connection with objects and closures; that is, quantification over representation predicates.   Each program is verified in its own application domain, so the program logic should have strong facilities and libraries for reasoning in the mathematics of many application domains.  So the program logic be embedded in a general-purpose logic and proof assistant such as Coq.  Verifiable C is a higher-order concurrent separation logic for C, embedded in Coq, as part of the Verified Software Toolchain. It is proved sound with a machine-checked proof in Coq. It assists users in interactively building correctness proofs for their C programs. In this talk I will explain the requirements, design, implementation, and practical use of the Verified Software Toolchain.      Bio: Andrew W.

The goal of IE is to extract structured facts from a wide spectrum of heterogeneous unstructured data types. Traditional IE techniques are limited to a certain source X (X = a particular language, domain, limited number of pre-defined fact types, single data modality, ...). When moving from X to a new source Y, we need to start from scratch again by annotating a substantial amount of training data and developing Y-specific extraction capabilities.    In this talk, I will present a new Universal IE paradigm to combine the merits of traditional IE (high quality and fine granularity) and Open IE (high scalability). This framework is able to discover schemas and extract facts from any input data in any domain, without any annotated training data or predefined schema, by combining distributional semantics and symbolic semantics. It can also be extended to thousands of languages and multiple data modalities (text, images, videos) by constructing a common semantic space and conducting transfer learning across sources. The resulting systems have won top performance at various NIST international research evaluations and been selected for DARPA and ARL demos and transitions.   Bio: Heng Ji is the Edward P.

As machines become more complex and hierarchical, describing what to do with the data is increasingly a first-class programming concern. Legion is a programming model and runtime system for describing hierarchical organizations of both data and computation at an abstract level. A separate mapping interface allows programmers to control how data and computation are placed onto the actual memories and processors of a specific machine. This talk will present the design of Legion, the novel issues that arise in both the design and implementation, and experience with applications.

In this talk, I will be using security as term that encompasses traditional security concepts and also privacy. Even a small error in the logic of a program can drastically weaken the security and privacy guarantees that it provides.   Existing work on applying formal methods to security has focused primarily on applying verification techniques to determine if an existing program satisfies a desired security guarantee. However, the challenge is to synthesize correct software from the outset. The key issue here is to balance security and functionality (a secure software that does nothing is easy to synthesize. Just do nothing:-))   In this talk, I will review some of the projects that I have worked on that balance the two competing requirements (i.e., security+privacy and functionality). I will then describe some interesting open problems along these lines.   Bio: Somesh Jha received his B.Tech from Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi in Electrical Engineering.

"Friday, November 10, 2017",1:30 pm,2405 Siebel Center,Feifei Li: Towards Building Interactive and Online Analytical Systems,"Supporting interactive queries and analytics over large data is a critical requirement in many data-driven applications. The classic external memory model based on IO optimizations no longer works well in the era of big data due to its high latency. Instead, newer systems (e.g., Spark, Impala) rely on in-memory computing over a cluster of commodity machines to offer scale-out interactive data analytics.    In the context of large spatio-temporal data, this talk presents the Simba system that offers scalable and efficient in-memory analytics over a cluster. Simba extends the Spark SQL engine to support rich query and analytical semantics through both SQL and DataFrame API (e.g., spatial join, knn join, trajectories).   An effective query optimizer leveraging its indexing support and geometry-aware query optimization is designed. Furthermore, the system is able to provide online analytics that explores the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff through novel online aggregation techniques that support complex multi-way join queries and random sampling over joins. Lastly, we will also present ongoing extensions to Simba that explores spatio-temporal learning and sentiment analysis over large data."

"Monday, November 27, 2017",4:00 pm,2405 Siebel Center,Laura Haas: Leveraging data and people to accelerate data science,"Abstract: Doing data science – extracting insight by analyzing data – is not easy. Data science is used to answer interesting questions that typically involve multiple diverse data sources, many different types of analysis, and often, large and messy data volumes. To answer one of these questions, several types of expertise may be needed to understand the context and domain being served, to import and transform individual data sets, to implement effective machine learning and/or statistical methods, to design and program applications and interfaces to extract and share data and insights, and to manage the data and systems used for analysis and storage.    The IBM Research Accelerated Discovery Lab studies how data scientists work, and uses the results to help them gain insights faster. In this talk, I will look at what has been learned to date, through user studies and experience with tens of analytics projects, and the environment that was built as a result. In particular, I will describe how our system captures information to enable contextual search, provenance queries, and other functionality to afford teams faster progress in data-intensive investigations. I will also touch on efforts to leverage data and people to explain what happens during an investigation, with an ultimate goal of moving from descriptive to prescriptive analytics in order to accelerate data science and the analytic process. I will illustrate these various efforts using an ambitious current project on applying metagenomics to food safety, and will conclude with a discussion of where more work is needed to accelerate – and perhaps eventually, automate – data science.   Bio: Prior to joining UMass, where she is the Dean of Computer & Information Science, Dr. Haas spent 36 years at IBM, where she was rose to the level of IBM Fellow.

Today, these scaling benefits are slowing to a crawl. If the computing industry wants to continue to make scalability the primary source of value in tomorrow's computing systems, we will have to quickly find new and productive ways to scale future systems. In this talk, I will highlight my work and the work of others that is rejuvenating scaling through the application of heterogeneous parallel designs. Leveraging these technologies to solve the scaling problem will be a significant challenge, as future scalability success will ultimately be less about “how” to do it and more about “how much” will it cost.

Siebel Center for Computer Science,"Daniel Genkin: ""Real World Security: From Theory to Practice and Back Again""","Abstract: The security of any system relies on models and assumptions that attempt to capture potential adversarial behavior. Unfortunately, when faced with real world adversaries, these assumptions often become flaky, inaccurate or even completely incorrect. In this talk, I will show several examples of this gap between theoretical and real-world security.   First, I will present Spectre and Meltdown, two microarchitectural attacks that read protected OS kernel memory by exploiting speculative execution, a performance optimization typically performed by all modern CPUs. Second, I will show how to utilize unintentional physical side-channel leakage from complex computing devices in order to extract secret cryptographic keys. Finally, on the defensive side, I will show how to bridge theory and practice by discussing how to construct and deploy verifiable computation schemes for arbitrary C programs.   The talk will discuss cryptographic techniques and will include live demonstrations.

This talk describes both theoretical and scientific contributions in the field of reinforcement learning, combinatorial optimization, and convex optimization, presented in the context of enabling mixed-autonomy mobility, the gradual and complex integration of automated vehicles into the existing traffic system.   The talk first presents new contributions in mixed-autonomy traffic, which explore and quantify the potential impact of a small fraction of automated vehicles on low-level traffic flow dynamics, using novel techniques in model-free deep reinforcement learning. Second, the talk presents reinforcement learning techniques for improved variance reduction developed for the control of complex large-scale systems such as mixed-autonomy traffic presented in the first part. To anchor this work in a broader mobility planning perspective, recent theoretical contributions in convex and combinatorial optimization, which contribute to challenges in higher-level individual and aggregate decision making in mixed-autonomy mobility will then be presented in the third part of the talk. More generally, the continued and accelerating introduction of automation into society will generate widespread yet poorly understood externalities. Therefore, this talk concludes by proposing a multi-scale design paradigm for developing sustainable and reliable intelligent infrastructure, which extends the current methodology for building AI systems, and a taxonomy of critical challenges both in machine learning and modeling, needed to address growing problems created by rapid urbanization.

Siebel Center for Computer Science,"Matthew O'Toole: ""Probing Light Transport for 3D Shape""","Abstract: There is a rising demand for high-performance 3D sensors in response to the rapid development of autonomous cars, 3D printers, and virtual/augmented reality systems. These sensors often make use of controllable light sources to send light signals into an environment, and cameras to measure the signal reflected back in response. This approach can, however, fail in critical scenarios where objects with complex material properties are present, when imaging objects under overwhelmingly bright sunlight, or when the object of interest is hidden behind an occluder.   In this talk, I will address these key challenges by presenting a new family of computational cameras that explicitly control what light paths contribute to an image. First, I will identify the crucial link between stereo geometry and light transport used to attenuate the contribution of multiply-scattered light paths which make 3D imaging hard. Second, I will show how this link can be further exploited to optimize the energy-efficiency of these camera systems, which enables 3D imaging under strong ambient lighting. Finally, I will explain how sampling a specific set of light paths leads to the derivation of an efficient, closed-form solution for reconstructing images of objects hidden from view.

"Friday, February 09, 2018",10:00 am,2405 Thomas M. Siebel Center for Computer Science,"Heng Ji: ""Universal Information Extraction""","Abstract: The big data boom in recent years covers a wide spectrum of heterogeneous data types, from text to image, video, speech, and multimedia. Most of the valuable information in such ""big data"" is encoded in natural language, which makes it accessible to some people — for example, those who can read that particular language — but much less amenable to computer processing beyond a simple keyword search. My focused research area, cross-source Information Extraction (IE) on a massive scale, aims to extract accurate, concise, and trustable information embedded in big data from heterogeneous sources, and thus create the next generation of information access in which humans can communicate with computers in any natural language.   Traditional IE approaches heavily relied on pre-defined schemas and a substantial amount of manual clean annotations for training, and thus they were limited to a certain domain, genre, language, and data modality. In this talk, I will present a new Universal IE paradigm to combine the merits of traditional IE (high quality and fine granularity) and Open IE (high scalability). This framework is able to discover schemas and extract facts from any input data in any domain, without any annotated training data or predefined schema, by combining distributional semantics and symbolic semantics. I will describe how to construct a common semantic space that is massively scalable across thousands of languages, multiple data modalities (text, images, videos), and sources. This common space is capable of representing knowledge elements at all scales from atomic entities to structured relations and events, conducting inference and transfering knowledge across sources. Because of this new paradigm, IE techniques, for the first time, can be extended from a dozen of knowledge types to thousands of types, from a few dominant languages to thousands of low-resource languages, from texts to multiple data modalities including images and videos, with higher quality and lower cost. The resulting systems have won top performance at various NIST international research evaluations for a decade and been selected for DARPA, ARL, AFRL, DTRA and FBI demos and transitions.

Simultaneously, computational systems are now fueled by people -- their interactions, data, and behavior. Consequently, there is a pressing need to design new algorithms that are socially responsible in how they learn, and socially optimal in the manner in which they use information. In this talk, I will share some of my research efforts to address such problems at this interface of social and computational systems. I will first explain the emergence of bias in algorithmic decision making and present first steps towards developing a systematic framework to control biases in classical problems such as data summarization and personalization. I will then consider how crowdsourced information is used, and new mechanisms that can increase diversity in a way that improves user experiences. Together, this work leads to new algorithms that have the ability to alleviate bias and increase diversity while often simultaneously maintaining their theoretical or empirical performance with respect to the original metrics.

This often leads to use of non-convex methods which do not necessarily come with computational/ statistical guarantees.     In this talk, we will explore the role of simple algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent, in optimizing non-convex functions, and leverage this to design efficient algorithms for a large and important class of machine learning problems: those involving the fitting of low-rank matrices to data. Later we will discuss a surprising role the local search methods play in implicitly regularizing the complexity of the over-parametrized models in problems involving both low rank matrices and deep neural networks.

However, the current state-of-the-art algorithms use complex optimization systems with heuristic components, and thus, are typically slow and produce sub-optimal results. Deep learning has the potential to revolutionize computer graphics by modeling problems in a data-driven and systematic way. However, the major challenge in applying deep learning to synthesis applications, such as view synthesis and high dynamic range imaging, is the task complexity and lack of large scale training data.   In this talk, I show how to address these problems by incorporating the underlying physical process of these applications into deep learning. Instead of solving one complex problem with deep learning, which is often intractable, I propose to break it into two smaller sub-problems that are physically motivated and easier to learn on limited training data. Specifically, I propose a novel, general two-stage framework, which can be applied (with slight modifications) to a variety of problems, including light field image synthesis, high dynamic range image and video generation, and Monte Carlo denoising.

To build increasingly functional, complex and integrated products, we need to create design tools that allow their users to efficiently explore high-dimensional design spaces by optimizing over a set of performance objectives that can be measured only by expensive computations. I will discuss how to overcome these challenges by 1) developing data-driven methods for efficient exploration of these large spaces and 2) performance-driven algorithms for automated design optimization based on high-level functional specifications. I will showcase how these two concepts are applied by developing new systems for designing robots, drones, and furniture. I will conclude my talk by discussing open problems and challenges for this emerging research field.

Siebel Center for Computer Science,"Ling Ren: ""Efficient and Egalitarian Consensus""","Abstract: The decentralized cryptocurrency Bitcoin popularized the notion of permissionless consensus. Bitcoin's solution, now known as the Nakamoto consensus, is to build a proof-of-work (PoW) chain and treat the longest PoW chain as consensus decisions. However, this elegant solution does have limitations. In this talk, I will present techniques to improve consensus protocols on multiple fronts.   A primary drawback of Nakamoto consensus is its long latency to confirm transactions. In contrast, the classical permissioned Byzantine consensus commits consensus decisions instantly. I will present Solida, a permissionless consensus protocol based on reconfigurable Byzantine consensus. I will then present an improved protocol for synchronous and authenticated Byzantine consensus, which tolerates 1/2 malicious participants and runs in expected 4 rounds (compared to expected 24 rounds from best prior work). Finally, Bitcoin’s hash-based PoW has raised concerns about fairness and energy consumption. I will describe my work on bandwidth-hard functions and proofs of space to address these concerns.

Siebel Center for Computer Science,"Aaditya Ramdas: ""A New Framework for Large-Scale Sequential A/B Testing""","Abstract: The current framework of large-scale A/B testing in the tech industry has several drawbacks. Firstly, the tests are often continuously monitored without correcting for the resulting inflation in the false alarm rate. Secondly, the number of samples used in the experiment grows linearly with the number of options being tested, independent of the quality of the options. Lastly, running hundreds or thousands of such tests artificially inflates the apparent number of significant discoveries, and companies have no idea what proportion of their discoveries are spurious.   We propose a new framework as an alternative to existing setups for controlling false alarms across multiple A/B tests, and tackles all three aforementioned issues. It combines ideas from pure exploration for best-arm identification in multi-armed bandits (MAB), with online false discovery rate (FDR) control. This framework has various applications, including pharmaceutical companies testing a control pill against a few treatment options, to internet companies testing their current default webpage (control) versus many alternatives (treatment). Our setup allows running a (possibly infinite) sequence of best-arm MAB instances, and controlling the overall FDR of the process in a fully online manner. We adapt existing theory from both the MAB and online FDR literature to ensure that our framework comes with strong sample-optimality guarantees, as well as control of the power and (a modified) FDR at any time.

While computer vision has made great strides in recent years, its predominant paradigm still focuses on analyzing image pixels to infer 2D output representations (bounding boxes, segmentation, etc.), which remain far from sufficient for real-world robotics applications.   In this talk, I will advocate the use of complete 3D scene representations that enable intelligent systems to not only recognize what is seen (e.g. Am I looking at a chair?), but also predict contextual information about the complete 3D environment beyond visible surfaces (e.g. What could be behind the table? Where should I look to find an exit?). As examples, I will present a line of my recent works that demonstrate the power of these representations through amodal 3D object detection (Sliding Shape and Deep Sliding Shapes), analyzing and synthesizing 3D scenes (Semantic Scene Completion), and predicting semantic and 3D structure outside the image field of view (Im2Pano3D). Finally, I will discuss some ongoing efforts on how these 3D scene representations can further enable and benefit from real-world robotic interactions (in the Amazon Robotic Challenge), shifting the way we view computer vision problems from the perspective of a passive observer to that of an active explorer.

Integrating silos of enterprise data is also a major challenge to business users. To address these issues, we have built an end-to- end data curation system, Data Civilizer, in cooperation with the Qatar Computing Research Institute.

This module accepts a collection of clusters of records thought to represent the same entity (i.e. duplicates) and merges each cluster into a single “golden” record. Next, I will show how to address the key challenges to enable scalable entity matching in Data Civilizer.

In this talk, I show how natural language processing techniques can be expanded from understanding the meanings of words and sentences to inferring the underlying social structures and processes they reflect. In so doing, we can identify and intervene in crucial societal issues. I apply these techniques to computationally detect two ways in which the social context affects language use: 1) social relations affecting how individuals interact with one another, and 2) social constructs shaping how institutions interact with communities.   First, I show how to computationally detect various manifestations of power in workplace interactions between individuals — providing means to study the effects of incivility in those settings. Second, I show how to computationally investigate the ways race shapes the interactions between the police and the communities they serve — providing means for law enforcement to address and monitor racial disparities in policing. Finally, I talk about how these methods can be expanded to address broader issues such as incivility in online interactions. My research looks beyond words and phrases and introduces ways to extract the richer rhetorical and dialog aspects of interactions, and demonstrates the importance of such in-depth language processing for the computational social sciences.

"Wednesday, March 14, 2018",10:00 am,2405 Thomas M. Siebel Center for Computer Science,"Joy Arulraj: ""Data Management on Non-Volatile Memory""","Abstract: We are at an exciting point in the evolution of memory technology. Device manufacturers have created a new non-volatile memory (NVM) technology that can serve as both system memory and storage. NVM supports fast reads and writes similar to volatile memory, but all writes to it are persistent like a solid-state disk. The advent of NVM invalidates decades of design decisions that are deeply embedded in today's database management systems (DBMSs). These systems are unable to take full advantage of NVM because their internal architectures are predicated on the assumption that memory is volatile. With NVM, many of the components of today's DBMSs are unnecessary and will degrade the performance of data-intensive applications. Thus, the best way to resolve these shortcomings is by designing a new system explicitly tailored for NVM.   In this talk, I will present my research on the design and development of an NVM DBMS, called Peloton. Peloton's architecture shows that the impact of NVM spans across all the layers of the DBMS. I will first introduce write-behind logging, an NVM-centric protocol that improves the availability of the database system by two orders-of-magnitude compared to the widely-used write-ahead logging protocol. I will then present the BzTree, an NVM-centric index data structure that illustrates how to simplify programming on NVM. In drawing broader lessons from this work, I will argue that all types of software systems, including file systems, machine-learning systems, and key-value stores, are amenable to similar architectural changes to achieve high performance and availability on NVM.

This talk introduces recent achievements and research directions in optimal motion planning. It then proceeds beyond algorithms for solving single problem instances to seek a deeper understanding of the global structure of families of related problems. Armed with this global understanding, we can design algorithms that reason about changes to constraints, plan simultaneously across spaces of problem instances, or use adapt experience between problems. These approaches lead to faster and higher quality plans, which are in some cases fast enough to be suitable for inner loops of feedback controllers. Moreover, global structure can be embedded into machine learning models that learn optimal controllers with substantially higher accuracy than black box approaches (e.g., deep neural networks).

In this talk, I will approach it from two perspectives: models and algorithms. Firstly, I will propose a model, LSTM-Jump, that can skip unimportant information in sequential data, mimicking the skimming behavior of human reading. Trained with an efficient reinforcement learning algorithm, this model can be several times faster than a vanilla LSTM in inference time. Then I will introduce a sequence encoding model that discards recurrent networks, which thus fully supports parallel training and inference. Based on this technique, a new question-answering model, QANet, is proposed. Combined with data augmentation approach via cyclic-translation, this model achieves No.1 performance in the competitive Stanford Question and Answer Dataset (SQuAD), while being times faster than the prevalent models.

The growing availability of data pertaining to such decisions offers an unprecedented opportunity to develop machine learning models which can aid human decision-makers in making better decisions. However, the applicability of machine learning to the aforementioned domains is limited by certain fundamental challenges:   1) The data is selectively labeled i.e., we only observe the outcomes of the decisions made by human decision-makers and not the counterfactuals. 2) The data is prone to a variety of selection biases and confounding effects. 3) The successful adoption of the models that we develop depends on how well decision-makers can understand and trust their functionality, however, most of the existing machine learning models are primarily optimized for predictive accuracy and are not very interpretable.    In this talk, I will describe novel computational frameworks which address the aforementioned challenges, thus, paving the way for large-scale deployment of machine learning models to address problems of significant societal impact. First, I will discuss how to build interpretable predictive models and explanations of complex black box models which can be readily understood and consequently trusted by human decision-makers. I will then outline efficient and provably near-optimal approximation algorithms to solve these problems. Next, I will present a novel evaluation framework which allows us to reliably compare the quality of decisions made by human decision-makers and machine learning models amidst challenges such as missing counterfactuals and presence of unmeasured confounders (unobservables).

Siebel Center for Computer Science,"Feifei Li: ""Random Sampling over Joins and Its Applications""","Abstract: Joins are expensive, especially on large data and/or multiple relations. One promising approach in mitigating their high costs is to just return a simple random sample of the full join results, which is sufficient for many tasks. Indeed, in as early as 1999, Chaudhuri et al. posed the problem of sampling over joins as a fundamental challenge in large database systems. They also pointed out a fundamental barrier for this problem, that the sampling operator cannot be pushed through a join, i.e., sample(R) ▷◁sample(S) does not yield sample(R ▷◁ S).  To overcome this barrier, they used precomputed statistics to guide the sampling process, but only showed how this works for two-relation joins.   This talk revisits this classic problem for both acyclic and cyclic multi-way joins. We demonstrate how to perform sampling over joins effectively and efficiently for different use-case scenarios. We start with a novel technique that is able to produce independent but non-uniform samples, and show its usefulness for the classic problem of online aggregation. We then extend this technique and we propose a general framework for random sampling over multi-way joins (a random sample consists of samples that are both independent and uniform). We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed technique for different applications, including interactive analytics and learning over joins. We analyze the properties of different instantiations of our framework and evaluate them against the baseline methods.

Often these networks are collected from different sources, at different time, at different granularities. State-of- the-art focuses on mining networks at three complementary levels, including the network-level at the coarsest granularity, the subgraph-level in the middle, and node/link-level at the finest granularity. In other words, an individual node or link is often the finest-granulated object (i.e., the atom) in a network mining model and algorithm.   In this talk, I will present our recent work on mining multiple inter-correlated networks, that allows us to go deeper inside a node or a link of a network, i.e., to model and mine networks hidden inside an atom (i.e., a node or a link). First, I will introduce a new data model for a network of networks, where the key idea is to leverage the network itself as a context to connect different networks. Second, I will present some algorithmic examples on how to perform mining with a network of networks, where the key idea is to leverage the contextual network as an effective regularizer during the mining process, including ranking and clustering. We believe that the power and beauty of networks of networks lie in thinking of networks as a context, and this vision (networks-as- a-context) goes well beyond network data. To demonstrate that, I will further introduce our other work on how to use networks as a powerful and unifying context to connect different types of data from different sources with different data mining algorithms, including a network of co-evolving time series, a network of regression models, a network of inference problems and a network of control problems.

Siebel Center for Computer Science,"Dakshita Khurana: ""Breaking Cryptographic Barriers""","Can we provably immunize protocols against coordinated attacks on the internet? Can we verify that computation is performed correctly while preserving the privacy of underlying data? Can we enable mutually distrusting participants to securely compute on distributed private data? These are some of the core challenges that lie at the heart of modern cryptography and secure protocol design.   In this talk, I will discuss my research that builds non-interactive secure protocols to address these challenges based on widely believed cryptographic hardness assumptions.   I will present new techniques that reimagine proofs of security to overcome known barriers and enable protocols that were previously believed to be impossible. These lay the foundations for preventing man-in-the-middle attacks, building variants of zero-knowledge proofs, and achieving other key cryptographic properties while for the first time, requiring only a single message from each participant.

Siebel Center for Computer Science,"Elena Glassman: ""Interactive Systems for Code and Data Demography""","Programming—the means by which we tell computers what to do—has changed a lot over time. Programming today means programming alongside hundreds of fellow students, thousands of fellow professional software engineers at a particular company, or millions of fellow developers in the open-source community sharing their code online. In this talk, I will describe several interactive systems I have built that exploit the structure within large volumes of peer-produced code to help communities of programmers learn about, reflect on, and teach how to write more correct, readable code.   These systems are made possible by code demography, which I define as statistics, algorithms, and visualizations that help people comprehend and interact with population-level structure and trends in large code corpora. The key to my approach is designing or inferring abstractions that capture critical features and abstract away variation that is irrelevant to the user. Code demography can reveal strategically diverse sets of aligned code examples which, according to theories of human concept learning, help people learn, i.e., construct mental abstractions that generalize well.   I will focus this talk on systems that use program analysis, program synthesis, and visualization to power active data-driven teaching in large programming classrooms and passive knowledge sharing within developer communities. As a result of integrating my systems into the course infrastructure of UC Berkeley’s largest introductory programming class (>1500 students), the teaching staff required to give composition feedback to the entire class have dropped from 35-40 to only 4-5 teachers. I will conclude with my vision for how the techniques of code demography can be generalized to more types of large complex data corpora and enable new data-driven programming paradigms.

Siebel Center for Computer Science,"Daniel Epstein: ""Everyday Personal Informatics""","Abstract: Personal tracking technology has made it easier for people to better understand themselves and their routines around exercise, eating, finances, and more. This self-knowledge can serve as a first step toward changing behaviors, increasing awareness, or simply satisfying a curiosity. Though some people succeed in achieving their goals, most encounter a fundamental barrier: the design principles used in tracking technology assume people are highly motivated, unwavering in their diligence, and have the expertise necessary to analyze their data.   In this talk, I will demonstrate how the design of tracking technology can be improved to help people overcome two challenges: (1) helping people find value in their tracking, and (2) helping people find support through their tracking. I will present generalizable opportunities for designs to overcome these challenges through a conceptual model and framework, and will describe four novel systems which evaluate design strategies that are uncovered by these opportunities. The novel systems demonstrate how designs can better surface interesting and actionable insights from data, support people after they have lapsed in tracking, help people create interesting shareable content from their tracked data, and scaffold an interested audience with which to share. I will conclude by discussing opportunities I am excited to explore in the future, including supporting the decision to track and the tool selection process, enabling opportunistic storytelling through tracked data, and developing more inclusive tracking technologies.   Bio: Daniel Epstein is a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington, where he is coadvised by James Fogarty and Sean Munson. Daniel's research examines how people use personal tracking technology today, using this understanding to inform the development of novel systems and generalizable models and frameworks.

There are two major avenues to get programs to run in parallel: parallelizing compilers and parallel languages and/or libraries. In this talk, we present our results using both approaches and draw some conclusions about their relative effectiveness and potential.   First, we describe the Hybrid Analysis (HA) compiler framework that can seamlessly integrate static and run-time analysis of memory references into a single framework capable of full automatic loop level parallelization. Experimental results on 26 benchmarks show full program speedups superior to those obtained by the Intel Fortran compilers.   Next, we present the Standard Template Adaptive Parallel Library (STAPL) based approach to write parallel code. STAPL is a collection of generic data structures and algorithms that provides a high productivity, parallel programming infrastructure analogous to the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). In this talk, we provide an overview of the major STAPL components with particular emphasis on graph algorithms. We then present scalability results of real codes using petascale machines such as IBM BG/Q and Cray. Finally, we present some of our ideas for future work in this area.

Siebel Center for Computer Science,"Jinguri He: ""Taming Data Heterogeneity: Towards a Unified Framework""","Abstract: Data heterogeneity is common across many high-impact application domains, ranging from national security to air traffic modeling, manufacturing, and healthcare. It is at the core of the 'Variety' aspect of big data. Such heterogeneity can be present in a variety of forms, including (1) task heterogeneity, where multiple related learning tasks can be jointly learned to improve the overall performance; (2) view heterogeneity, where complementary information is available from various sources; (3) oracle heterogeneity, where multiple oracles may have different opinions regarding the true label of an example; and (4) instance heterogeneity, where a single example can be decomposed into a set of instances with heterogeneous labels.    In this talk, I will present our recent work towards building a unified framework for learning from such data heterogeneity, focusing on the co-existence of multiple types of data heterogeneity such as task and oracle dual heterogeneity. The goal is to enable the learning model to enjoy the best of all possible worlds. In particular, I will hinge on the application of accident phase classification in air traffic modeling, discuss the problem-specific data heterogeneity, and our proposed tensor-based model for learning from such data heterogeneity, together with empirical results on various data sets. Finally, I will conclude the talk by sharing my vision for heterogeneous learning in the future.
