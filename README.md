# UIUC Event Recommender

This is a course project for CS410, Spring 2018.

# Goal

Goal of this project is to provide UIUC students a platform where they can receive their personalized event list. 
Given there are so many events in UIUC, it is very hard for someone to track all the events from different departments.
As a result, this event recommender system will push events based on user profile, and update the user profile based on
feedback.
