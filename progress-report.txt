Progress Report:
1. What has been done:
We have prepared some training datasets, including ~1000 CS events and ~1000 LAS events (We would like to extend the project slightly to include events in more departments). Each event crawled contains date, time, title, location, and detailed description of the event.

2. What remains to be done:
Current model seem to be relatively easy, need more work to improve that to have better performance.
3. Barriers:
We may not have enough time to set up server and develop frontend user interface. Current plan is to have our system able to read a file which simulates user interactions.
